"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"Using semi-empirical AM1 calculation and 6.31G basis sets, we have calculated the energy of the highest-occupied molecular orbital EHOMO for anti-inflammatory 4,5-diarylpyrroles which have been shown to have inhibitory activity on cyclooxygenase COX-2, an inducible enzyme expressed during inflammation. We have found a correlation between the EHOMO of a molecule and its COX-2 inhibition. However, no correlation was observed between EHOMO and the inhibition efficiency of cyclooxygenase-1 COX-1, the constitutively expressed enzyme, protective to the organism. This result suggests that the inhibitions of the two isoforms follow different molecular mechanisms."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug usage has long revealed renoprotective prostaglandin actions on the renal microvasculature during increased pressor hormone influence, but whether increased cyclooxygenase COX-2 expression supports prostaglandin vasodilatory influence by interfering with the actions of ANG II remains unresolved. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that COX-2 inhibition causes hemodynamic and excretory effects that are increased in proportion to ANG II activity. In anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats having augmented cortical COX-2 expression but different ANG II activity, we conducted renal clearance experiments during acute inhibition of COX-2 with nimesulide NMSLD and inhibition of COX-1 with SC-560. In one series of experiments, acute captopril acute angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE inhibitor aACEi was administered alone n = 13 or in combination with chronic captopril chronic ACEi cACEi pretreatment n = 19. In another series of experiments, rats were fed a normal-sodium 0.4 NS, n = 12 or a low-sodium 0.03 LS, n = 18 diet. NMSLD did not alter mean arterial blood pressure in any group but, in the LS and cACEi groups, decreased renal plasma flow from 3.99  0.33 to 2.85  0.26 and from 4.30  0.19 to 3.22  0.21 mlmin-1g-1, cortical blood flow -12  8 and -13  4, and glomerular filtration rate from 0.88  0.04 to 0.65  0.05 and from 0.95  0.07 to 0.70  0.05 mlmin-1g-1. In contrast, medullary blood flow MBF was significantly decreased by COX-2 inhibition in NS -24  5, LS -27  8, aACEi -16  3.8, and cACEi -24  4.2 groups. Absolute and fractional sodium excretion rates were unchanged by NMSLD, except in the LS group 0.75  0.05 eq/min and 0.43  0.15 and 0.51  0.06 eq/min and 0.26  0.10. SC-560 did not augment the effects of NMSLD. These results demonstrate an augmented COX-2-mediated vasodilation that is not contingent on ANG II, in contrast to COX-2-mediated augmented sodium excretion, where ANG II activity is requisite. Furthermore, the COX-2 effects on MBF are not contingent on ANG II or changes in cortical microvascular responses. These results reflect COX-2 continual regulation of MBF and adaptive opposition to ANG II prohypertensinogenic effects on renal plasma flow, cortical blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and absolute and fractional sodium excretion."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand TRAIL is a promising anticancer agent which selectively kills cancer cells with little effect on normal cells. However, TRAIL resistance is widely found in cancer cells. We have previously reported antimetatstatic and antiangiogenic effects of vanillin, a flavoring agent from vanilla. Here we have evaluated the sensitizing effect of vanillin on a TRAIL-resistant human cervical cancer cell line, HeLa.   MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell viability after treatments was determined by the WST-1 cell counting kit. Apoptosis was demonstrated by detection of caspase-3 activation and cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase using immunoblot analysis. Effect of treatments on TRAIL signaling pathway and nuclear factor kappaB FN-kappaB activation was studied using immunoblot analysis and luciferase reporter assay.   RESULTS Pretreatment of HeLa cells with vanillin enhanced TRAIL-induced cell death through the apoptosis pathway. Vanillin pretreatment inhibited TRAIL-induced phosphorylation of p65 and transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB.   CONCLUSION Vanillin sensitizes HeLa cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by inhibiting NF-kappaB activation."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"In this study, we attempted to derive a comprehensive SAR picture for the class of acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibitors related to tacrine, a drug currently in use for the treatment of the Alzheimers disease. To this aim, we synthesized and tested a series of 9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine derivatives substituted in the positions 6 and 7 of the acridine nucleus and bearing selected groups on the 9-amino function. By means of the Hansch approach, QSAR equations were obtained, quantitatively accounting for both the detrimental steric effect of substituents in position 7 and the favorable electron-attracting effect exerted by substituents in positions 6 and 7 of the 9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine derivatives. The three-dimensional 3D properties of the inhibitors were taken into consideration by performing a CoMFA analysis on the series of AChE inhibitors made by 12 9-amino-1,2,3, 4-tetrahydroacridines and 13 11H-indeno1,2-bquinolin-10-ylamines previously developed in our laboratory. The alignment of the molecules to be submitted to the CoMFA procedure was carried out by taking advantage of docking models calculated for the interactions of both the unsubstituted 9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine and 11H-indeno1,2-bquinolin-10-ylamine with the target enzyme. A highly significant CoMFA model was obtained using the steric field alone, and the features of such a 3D QSAR model were compared with the classical QSAR equations previously calculated. The two models appeared consistent, the main aspects they had in common being a the individuation of the strongly negative contribution of the substituents in position 7 of tacrine and b a tentative assignment of the hydrophobic character to the favorable effect exerted by the substituents in position 6. Finally, a new previously unreported tacrine derivative designed on the basis of both the classical and the 3D QSAR equations was synthesized and kinetically evaluated, to test the predictive ability of the QSAR models. The 6-bromo-9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine was predicted to have a pIC50 value of 7.31 by the classical QSAR model and 7.40 by the CoMFA model, while its experimental IC50 value was equal to 0.066 /-0.009 microM, corresponding to a pIC50 of 7.18, showing a reasonable agreement between predicted and observed AChE inhibition data."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Apoptosis involves mitochondrial steps such as the release of the apoptogenic factor cytochrome c which are effectively blocked by Bcl-2. Although Bcl-2 may have a direct action on the mitochondrial membrane, it also resides and functions on the endoplasmic reticulum ER, and there is increasing evidence for a role of the ER in apoptosis regulation as well. Here we uncover a hitherto unrecognized, apoptotic crosstalk between the ER and mitochondria that is controlled by Bcl-2. After triggering massive ER dilation due to an inhibition of secretion, the drug brefeldin A BFA induces the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria in a caspase-8- and Bid-independent manner. This is followed by caspase-3 activation and DNA/nuclear fragmentation. Surprisingly, cytochrome c release by BFA is not only blocked by wild-type Bcl-2 but also by a Bcl-2 variant that is exclusively targeted to the ER Bcl-2/cb5. Similar findings were obtained with tunicamycin, an agent interfering with N-linked glycosylations in the secretory system. Thus, apoptotic agents perturbing ER functions induce a novel crosstalk between the ER and mitochondria that can be interrupted by ER-based Bcl-2."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Acetylcholinesterase is a prime target for therapeutic intervention in Alzheimers disease. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors AChEIs are used to improve cognitive abilities, playing therefore an important role in disease management. Drug repurposing screening has been performed on a corporate chemical library containing 11 353 compounds using a target fishing approach comprising three-dimensional 3D shape similarity and pharmacophore modeling against an approved drug database, Drugbank. This initial screening identified 108 hits. Among them, eight molecules showed structural similarity to the known AChEI drug, pyridostigmine. Further structure-based screening using a pharmacophore-guided rescoring method identifies one more potential hit. Experimental evaluations of the identified hits sieve out a highly selective AChEI scaffold. Further lead optimization using a substructure search approach identifies 24 new potential hits. Three of the 24 compounds compounds 10b, 10h, and 10i based on a 6-2-pyrrolidin-1-ylpyrimidin-4-yl-thiazolo3,2-apyrimidine scaffold showed highly promising AChE inhibition ability with IC50 values of 13.10  0.53, 16.02  0.46, and 6.22  0.54 M, respectively. Moreover, these compounds are highly selective toward AChE. Compound 10i shows AChE inhibitory activity similar to a known Food and Drug Administration FDA-approved drug, galantamine, but with even better selectivity. Interaction analysis reveals that hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions are the primary driving forces responsible for the observed high affinity of the compound with AChE."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",L-type calcium channel blockade,"The aim of the present investigation was to compare the antiepileptic efficacy of the specific L-type calcium channel blocker nifedipine in hippocampal and neocortical slice preparations in the Mg2-free model of epilepsy. The main findings were as follows. 1 In hippocampal slices, in general, nifedipine 20-80 micromol/l exerted a suppressive effect both on repetition rate and on area under epileptiform field potentials. This effect was clearly dose dependent. In the majority of cases, this suppression was preceded by an increase, which was transient in nature. Only in the lowest concentration 20 micromol/l used, in normal K, instead of a depression, a persistent increase occurred. 2 In neocortical slices, in the majority of experiments, nifedipine 20-80 micromol/l showed a depressive action only on the area under the epileptiform field potentials. The depressive effect of nifedipine on the area was dose dependent, although to a lesser extent than in the hippocampus. In nearly half of the slices this suppression was preceded by a transient increase. By contrast, the repetition rate of epileptiform field potentials increased transiently in about 20 of the slices followed by a decrease. In the remaining 80 of the slices the repetition rate increased persistently. 3 An elevation of the K concentration accentuated the depressive actions of nifedipine only in the hippocampus. In contrast to elevated K, in both the hippocampus and the neocortex, epileptiform field potentials were not suppressed in all experiments in normal K. 4 The reversibility of the depressive effects of nifedipine was differential in the two tissue types. In the hippocampus, after suppression of epileptiform field potentials they reappeared in the overwhelming majority of slices. In the neocortex, this was the case in only one experiment. These findings may indicate the existence of L-type calcium channels with a differential functional significance for epileptogenesis and/or the existence of different forms of L-type channels in hippocampal and neocortical tissue. As a whole, the differential effects of L-type calcium channel blockade in the hippocampus and neocortex point to differences in the network properties of the two tissue types."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have potential for use in the prevention and/or treatment of colorectal cancer. We have studied the cytotoxic effect of a specific COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, against LLC, HCA-7, and HCT-15 cells grown in cell culture and have compared these results with its effect on HCA-7 cells grown as xenografts in nude mice. ""High-dose"" celecoxib gt20 microM reduced the viability of all three cell lines in vitro as measured by the 3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that this loss of viability was attributable to the induction of apoptosis. Significantly, concentrations of the drug lt10 microM had no effect on cell viability in vitro. The cytotoxic effects of high-dose celecoxib were independent of COX-2 inhibition because similar effects were observed in cox-2 /, cox-2 /- and cox-2 -/- fibroblasts. A plasma concentration of 2.3/-0.7 microM was achieved when celecoxib 1250 mg/kg of chow was fed to animals ad libitum. Despite a lack of toxicity at 2-3 microM celecoxib in vitro, there was attenuation of HCA-7 xenograft growth in vivo. Celecoxib had no effect on apoptosis, cell division, or the epithelial architecture of the normal gut in treated mice. These results support the need for additional clinical evaluation of celecoxib for treatment and/or prevention of colorectal cancer in humans."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Platelet activating factor PAF has been suggested to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. We assessed the effect of PAF against the toxicity of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium MPP, a parkinsonian toxin, in relation to apoptotic process. PAF exhibited differential effect against the MPP toxicity in differentiated PC12 cells depending on concentration. Treatment with 0.75 microM PAF significantly attenuated the MPP-induced increase in Bax levels, decrease in Bid and Bcl-2 levels, and mitochondrial membrane potential loss that lead to the release of cytochrome c and subsequent caspase-3 activation. The inhibitory effect of PAF was not associated with nuclear factor-kappaB activation. In contrast, PAF at the concentrations greater than 2.5 microM exhibited a toxicity and additive effect on the MPP toxicity. The results show that PAF at low concentrations, which does not induce a significant toxicity, may prevent the MPP toxicity by suppressing the apoptosis-related protein activation and mitochondrial membrane permeability change that lead to the cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation. The preventive effect seems to be associated with the inhibitory effect on the formation of reactive oxygen species and depletion of GSH. In contrast, PAF at higher concentrations may exhibit an additive toxic effect against the MPP toxicity by increasing apoptosis-related protein activation."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Using conditionally replicating adenoviral vectors CRAds is a promising strategy in the treatment of solid tumors. The prospective of this study was to design a novel CRAd for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancer and show its efficacy in vitro, as well as in vivo. To determine if aberrant wnt signaling in tumor cells can be used to selectively drive viral replication, we analyzed six colorectal and hepatocellular cell lines, as well as 13 colorectal tumors and 17 gastric tumors, for -catenin mutation status or aberrant wnt signaling, both of which were found frequently. Based on these findings, a novel CRAd Ad5F11.wnt-E1A-hIL24 containing an E1A expression cassette driven by an artificial wnt promoter and delivering an apoptosis-inducing gene, interleukin-24 IL24, was engineered. To enhance infection efficiency, the virus was pseudotyped by replacing adenovirus serotype 5 Ad5 with Ad11 fiber. Ad5F11.wnt-E1A-hIL24 virus exhibited high selectivity toward cells with aberrant wnt signaling both in vitro and in mouse xenograft tumors. Transduction efficiency was significantly improved compared with that of nonpseudotyped control viruses. The proliferation of tumor cell lines, as well as tumor growth, in mouse xenografts could be profoundly inhibited by viral infection with Ad5F11.wnt-E1A-hIL24. The therapeutic effect was associated with increased apoptosis through caspase-3 activation. In addition, Ad5F11b vector exhibited a more favorable biodistribution, blood clearance, and transgene expression compared with conventional Ad5 vector after systemic or intratumoral injection in human gastrointestinal cancer xenografts. We think that our approach is a promising strategy in the treatment of gastrointestinal cancer, warranting further clinical investigation."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Phosfolan Cyolane, 2-diethoxy phosphinylimino-1,3-dithiolane is one of the widely used insecticides in Egypt specially to protect cotton plants. The hazard of exposure of the spray workers team in the field was estimated in terms of the amount of Phosfolan insecticide retained on workmen body pads during field spraying. The health effect of such exposure was determined through recording of the AChE inhibition in the red blood cells at different intervals after exposure. The calculated percentage of the toxic dose received per every spraying day for each worker varied with the type of job in the range of 0.008 to 0.03 percent. The body of the mixer received the maximum exposure with 10 to 12 fold that of the assistants. The highly exposed group of workers suffered from 31 to 44 percent RBCs AChE inhibition. About half of the inhibited enzyme activity recovered after 48 hours. Then it took more than 3-4 weeks to reach complete recovery. Thus the RBCs AChE activity can be recommended as a criterion for the level of exposure to organophosphorous insecticides."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Increased beta-amyloid Abeta production and its aggregation to the oligomeric state is considered to be a major cause of Alzheimers disease AD. Therefore, reducing Abeta-induced neurotoxicity could provide a suitable means of prevention or intervention in the disease course of AD. The neuroprotective effects of isolates from Callistemon lanceolatus DC. Myrtaceae against Abeta were evaluated using PC12 cells. To evaluate the effects of Abeta on apoptotic cell death and the effects of Bcl-2 family proteins and caspase-3, TUNEL assays and Western blotting were performed, respectively. Substantial fractionation and purification of the EtOAc-soluble extract of the aerial parts of C. lanceolatus afforded six flavonoids, 4,5-dihydroxy-6,8-dimethyl-7-methoxyflavanone 1, eucalyptin 2, 8-demethyleucalyptin 3, sideroxylin 4, syzalterin 5, and quercetin 6. Compounds 1, 5, and 6 were found to protect PC12 cells effectively against Abeta-induced toxicity. In particular, compound 1 showed the most promising neuroprotective effect with an ED 50 value of 6.7 microM in terms of decreasing Abeta-induced apoptotic cell death, and this was accompanied by a decrease in caspase-3 activation and an increase in Bcl-2/Bax ratio. These results suggest that compound 1 could be developed as a candidate anti-AD agent due to its attenuation of Abeta-induced apoptotic cell death."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"The present work proposed the preparation of triazolic analogues of tyrosol, a biophenol found in olive oil and whose wide range of bioactivities has been the target of many studies. We obtained fifteen novel tyrosol derivatives and the compounds of the series were later evaluated as acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibitors. The study of AChE inhibition is important for the development of new drugs and pesticides, and especially the research for managing Alzheimers disease. The most active compound, namely 7-1-2-4-hydroxyphenylethyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-ylmethoxy-4-methyl-2H-chromen-2-one 30, showed IC50 value of 14.66  2.29 mol L-1. Docking experiments corroborated by kinetic assay are suggestive of a competitive inhibition mechanism. Derivatives interacted with amino acids from the AChE active site associated to the development of Alzheimers disease. The results indicate that the compounds synthesized have a high potential as prototypes for the development of new acetylcholinesterase inhibitors."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of tetrandrine plus arsenic trioxide on HCC1937 cells, a triple negative breast cancer cell line, and to explore possible mechanisms.   METHODS The 3-4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method was used to compare the antiproliferative effects of tetrandrine, arsenic trioxide alone and tetrandrine plus arsenic trioxide on HCC1937 cells. The median-effect principle Chou-Talalay combination index method was used to examine the interaction between the two drugs. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate effects of treatment with tetrandrine, arsenic trioxide or the combination of both on HCC1937 cell apoptosis. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were performed to evaluate changes in apoptosis-related gene expression and protein levels.   RESULTS Tetrandrine and arsenic trioxide each inhibited HCC1937 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The cell inhibition rate of HCC1937 cells treated with a combination of tetrandrine and arsenic trioxide was significantly higher than with either compound alone. The two drugs produced a synergistic effect when the inhibition rate was 20-40. Flow cytometry results showed that treatment with the two drugs increased the proportion of apoptotic cells. In the combination treated group, caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage were significantly higher than in the other groups. Moreover, Bcl-2 and survivin expression were decreased, whereas that of both Bid and Bax was increased.   CONCLUSION These findings demonstrated that tetrandrine plus arsenic trioxide had synergistic efficacy on induction of apoptosis in HCC1937 cells."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",EGFR signaling pathway,"Ornithine decarboxylase ODC overexpressed from a heterologous promoter drives the tumorigenic transformation of NIH 3T3 cells and provides a model to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. These transformed cells, designated NODC cells, exhibit elevated levels of epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR tyrosine kinase Tyr-k activity relative to control transfected cells and inhibition of EGFR Tyr-k activation suppresses the transformed growth phenotype of these cells. Thus, ODC-induced transformation of NIH 3T3 cells appears to be mediated, at least in part, by enhanced signaling through the EGFR pathway. Here we extend these studies by evaluating i the effects on growth regulation of overexpressing ODC in EGFR-deficient NIH 3T3 cells ii the potential role of TGFalpha in mediating the EGFR-dependent transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by ODC. Disruption of EGFR-TGFalpha interactions either by deleting EGFR, by treatment with anti-TGFalpha neutralizing antibody or by transfection with a TGFalpha antisense expression vector suppressed acquisition of the full transformed growth phenotype. Specifically, the loss of contact inhibition and the capacity for clonogenic growth appear more dependent on EGFR-TGFalpha interactions than anchorage-independent growth in ODC-overexpressing cells. ODC overexpression does not alter the amount, localization or secretion of TGFalpha. Thus, TGFalpha is not the ODC-responsive component of the EGFR signaling pathway but appears to be critically involved in development of the transformed phenotype of NODC cells."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"The phenomenon of aging arises from multiple, complex interactions causing dysfunction in cells and organs. In particular, fertility drastically decreases with age. Previously, we have demonstrated that the functional characteristics of the bovine oviduct and uterus change with the age-dependent upregulation of inflammation and noted that S100A9 triggers inflammatory responses in oviduct epithelial cells. In the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that S100A9 affects reproductive events to aspect such as sperm function, fertilization, and the development of the embryo in cows. To investigate the effect of S100A9 on bovine sperm, we incubated sperms in vitro with S100A9 for 5 h and observed significantly decreased sperm motility and viability. During in vitro fertilization, S100A9 treatment for 5 h did not affect the rate of fertilization, time of first division of embryos, or embryo development to blastocyst stage. Treatment of 2-cell stage embryos with S100A9 for 5 h significantly reduced the proportion of cells undergoing normal division 4-8 cell embryos and embryo development to the blastocyst stage. In experiment involving 24 h treatment of 2-cell embryos, the development of all embryos stopped at the 2-cell stage in the S100A9-treated group. In blastocyst-stage embryos, S100A9 treatment significantly stimulated the expression of endoplasmic reticulum ER and the mRNA expression of ER stress markers, and activated caspase-3 with subsequent nuclear fragmentation. Pre-treatment with an ER stress inhibitor significantly suppressed caspase-3 activation by the S100A9 treatment, suggesting that S100A9 induces blastocyst dysfunction by apoptosis via caspase-3 activation depending on ER stress. These results indicate that direct exposure to S100A9 exerted adverse effects on sperm function and embryo development. These findings suggest that excessive dose of S100A9 may have an adverse effect to the reproductive machinery by inducing inflammation and tissue dysfunction."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",PPARgamma activation,"OBJECTIVE Nifedipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, protects against the progression of atherosclerosis. We investigated the molecular basis of the antiatherosclerotic effect of nifedipine in macrophages and apolipoprotein E-deficient mice.   METHODS AND RESULTS In macrophages, nifedipine increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma PPARgamma activity without increasing PPARgamma-binding activity. Amlodipine, another L-type calcium channel blocker, and 1,2-bis-o-aminophenoxy-ethane-N,N,-N,N-tetraacetic acid tetraacetoxy-methyl ester BAPTA-AM, a calcium chelator, decreased PPARgamma activity, suggesting that nifedipine does not activate PPARgamma via calcium channel blocker activity. Inactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 suppressed PPARgamma2-Ser112 phosphorylation and induced PPARgamma activation. Nifedipine suppressed extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation and PPARgamma2-Ser112 phosphorylation, and mutating PPARgamma2-Ser112 to Ala abrogated nifedipine-mediated PPARgamma activation. These results suggested that nifedipine inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activity and PPARgamma2-Ser112 phosphorylation, leading to PPARgamma activation. Nifedipine inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression and induced ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 mRNA expression, and these effects were abrogated by small interfering RNA for PPARgamma. Furthermore, in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, nifedipine treatment decreased atherosclerotic lesion size, phosphorylation of PPARgamma2-Ser112 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mRNA expression and increased ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 expression in the aorta.   CONCLUSIONS Nifedipine unlike amlodipine inhibits PPARgamma-Ser phosphorylation and activates PPARgamma to suppress monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression and induce ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 expression in macrophages. These effects may induce antiatherogenic effects in hypertensive patients."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"To investigate the mode of zinc-induced cell death, the associated morphological changes, and biological events were examined in zinc-treated Molt-4 cells. Fluorescence microscope observations with double staining of zinc-treated cells with Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide PI indicated that the metal induced both necrosis and apoptosis. To confirm this, cells were stained with both PI and FITC-labeled annexin V, which binds phosphatidylserine, and then analyzed by flow cytometry. The results also confirmed that zinc induces mixed types of cell death, necrosis and apoptosis, and that the former induction occurs earlier and at a greater frequency. Hallmarks of apoptosis such as abnormal chromosome condensation and release of cytochrome c, as well as the appearance of annexin-positive cells, appeared along with the expression of mitochondrial membrane protein 7A6. However, zinc did not induce increases in caspase-3 like protease and caspase-8 activities, and caused slightly hypodiploid cells. Furthermore, the induction of cell death and annexin-positive cells was not blocked by the caspase inhibitors Ac-YVAD-CHO and Ac-DEVD-CHO. These results indicate that zinc induces both necrosis and apoptosis, without caspase-3 activation."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"AIM OF THE STUDY To investigate the neuroprotective effects of water-soluble Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides GLPS on cerebral ischemic injury in rats, and to explore the involved mechanisms.   MATERIALS AND METHODS Two models middle cerebral artery occlusion MCAO in Sprague-Dawley SD rats and oxygen and glucose deprivation OGD in primary cultured rat cortical neurons were employed to mimic ischemia-reperfusion I/R damage, in vivo and in vitro, respectively. Cerebral infarct area was measured by tetrazolium staining, and neurological functional deficits were assessed at 24h after I/R. Neuronal apoptosis was studied by Nissl staining and DNA fragmentation assay. Neuronal injury was assessed by morphological examination using phase-contrast microscopy and quantified by measuring the amount of lactate dehydrogenase LDH leakage, cell viability was measured by sodium 3-1- phenylaminocarbonyl-3, 4-tetrazolium-bis 4-methoxy-6-nitro benzene sulfonic acid XTT reduction. Neuronal apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry, and electron microscopy was used to study morphological changes of neurons. Caspase-3, -8 and -9 activation and Bcl-2, Bax protein expression were determined by western blot analysis.   RESULTS Oral administration of GLPS 100, 200 and 400mg/kg significantly reduced cerebral infarct area, attenuated neurological functional deficits, and reduced neuronal apoptosis in ischemic cortex. In OGD model, GLSP 0.1, 1 and 10 microg/ml effectively reduced neuronal cell death and relieved cell injury. Moreover, GLPS decreased the percentage of apoptotic neurons, relieved neuronal morphological damage, suppressed overexpression of active caspases-3, -8 and -9 and Bax, and inhibited the reduction of Bcl-2 expression.   CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that GLPS protects against cerebral ischemic injury by inhibiting apoptosis by downregulating caspase-3 activation and modulating the Bcl-2/Bax ratio."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",PPARgamma activation,"The euglycemic and hypolipidemic activities of PAT5A, a novel pyridine analog of thiazolidinedione, have been evaluated in different animal models. Administration of PAT5A to db/db mice resulted in dose-dependent decreases in plasma glucose, triglyceride, and insulin levels, and an improved glucose tolerance. The glucose-lowering activity of PAT5A was better than that of troglitazone and comparable to that of rosiglitazone. In addition, PAT5A showed better lipid-lowering activity than troglitazone or rosiglitazone. A similar profile was seen in ob/ob mice. In high-fat-fed Sprague Dawley rats, PAT5A treatment reduced plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol levels. An in vitro peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma PPARgamma transactivation assay in HEK-293 cells showed poor transactivation for PAT5A compared with rosiglitazone. PAT5A did not show any PPARalpha- or PPARdelta-activating properties. Ex vivo study in db/db mice treated with PAT5A showed decreased activity of liver glucose 6-phosphatase, a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis. A 28-day probe toxicity study in Wistar rats did not show any treatment-related alterations in hematologic and biochemical parameters, nor any macroscopic and microscopic changes in the vital organs, whereas rosiglitazone treatment increased liver and heart weights. Our results indicate that PAT5A is a potent insulin sensitizer and hypolipidemic compound with a weak PPARgamma activation potential. Both in vivo and in vitro results suggest that PAT5A improves glucose kinetics and lipid levels through mechanisms not related to PPAR activation."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Fathead minnows Pimephales promelas were exposed to Dursban during a chronic toxicity test for 200 days including a reproductive period of their life cycle. The fish concentrated Dursban approximately 1700 times. Survival of first-generation fish was adversely affected at 2.68 micrograms/liter within 60 days. A significant increase in deformities occurred at 2.68 micrograms/liter within 30 days. Growth was significantly reduced at 2.68 micrograms/liter within 30 days and at 1.21 micrograms/liter by 60 days. Maturation of the first-generation fish was reduced at all Dursban exposures and reproduction was significantly reduced at 0.63 micrograms/liter and above. Growth and estimated biomass of 30-day-old second-generation fish were significantly reduced at 0.12 micrograms/liter, the lowest concentration tested. Brain acetylcholinesterase AChE activity was significantly inhibited at 0.27 micrograms/liter and above. AChE inhibition ranged from near 10 in fish exposed at 0.12 micrograms/liter to 89 for those exposed at 2.68 micrograms/liter. Inhibition results are compared to other results demonstrated during the chronic study. The use of exposure units exposure concentration X exposure duration is discussed as a tool for determining the effects of organophosphate pesticides on the environment."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"The ailments related to a malfunction in cholinergic functioning currently employ the use of inhibitors for acetylcholinesterase AChE and N-methyl-d-aspartate NMDA receptors. The present study was designed to elucidate the potential of swertiamarin SW, a secoiridoidal glycoside isolated from Enicostemma littorale in curtailing the cholinergic dysfunction. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model, SW was found to enhance neurotransmission by modulating AChE and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor nAChR activity being orchestrated through up-regulation of unc-17 and unc-50. SW exhibited AChE inhibition both in vivo and cell-free system. The in silico molecular docking of SW and human AChE hAChE displayed good binding energy of -6.02. Interestingly, the increase in aldicarb and levamisole sensitivity post SW treatment was curtailed to a significant level in daf-16 and skn-1 mutants. SW raised the level of the endogenous antioxidant enzymes through up-regulation of sod-3 and gst-4 that act downstream to DAF-16 and SKN-1, imparting protection against neurodegeneration. The outcome of our study displays SW as a potential natural molecule for the amelioration of cholinergic dysfunction. Moreover, the study also indicates that SW elicits antioxidant response via up-modulation of daf-16 possibly through unc-17 upregulation. Further research on SW pertaining to the underlying mechanism and potential is expected to significantly advance the current understanding and design of possible ameliorative or near ameliorative regimens for cholinergic dysfunction."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Studies with acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibited by organophosphorus OP compounds with two chiral centers can serve as models or surrogates for understanding the rate, orientation, and postinhibitory mechanisms by the nerve agent soman that possesses dual phosphorus and carbon chiral centers. In the current approach, stereoisomers of O-methyl, S-succinic acid, diethyl ester, O-4-nitrophenyl phosphorothiolate MSNPs were synthesized, and the inhibition, reactivation, and aging mechanisms were studied with electric eel AChE eeAChE and recombinant mouse brain AChE rmAChE. The MSNP RPRC isomer was the strongest inhibitor of both eeAChE and rmAChE at 8- and 24-fold greater potency, respectively, than the weakest SPSC isomer. eeAChE inhibited by the RPRC- or RPSC-MSNP isomer underwent spontaneous reactivation 10- to 20-fold faster than the enzyme inhibited by SPRC- and SPSC-MSNP, and only 4 spontaneous reactivation was observed from the SPRC-eeAChE adduct. Using 2-pyridine aldoxime methiodide 2-PAM or trimedoxime TMB-4, eeAChE inhibited by RPRC- or SPRC-MSNP reactivated up to 90 and 3- to 4-fold faster than eeAChE inhibited by the RPSC- or SPSC-MSNP isomer. Spontaneous reactivation rates for rmAChE were 1.5- to 10-fold higher following inhibition by RPSC- and SPSC-MSNPs than inhibition by either RC isomer, a trend opposite to that found for eeAChE. Oxime reactivation of rmAChE following inhibition by RPRC- and SPRC-MSNPs was 2.5- to 5-fold faster than inhibition by RPSC- or SPSC-MSNPs. Due to structural similarities, MSNPs that phosphylate AChE with the loss of the p-nitrophenoxy PNP group form identical, nonreactivatable adducts to those formed from SP-isomalathion however, all the MSNP isomers inhibited AChE to form adducts that reactivated. Thus, MSNPs inactivate AChE via the ejection of either PNP or thiosuccinyl groups to form a combination of reactivatable and nonreactivatable adducts, and this differs from the mechanism of AChE inhibition by isomalathion."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Nitrobenzene, nitrotoluenes and nitrobenzoic acid are toxic and mutagenic. Their removal from the environment is necessary to avoid health and environmental damage. In this study, Cupriavidus strain a3 was found to utilize 2-nitrotoluene 2NT, 3-nitrotoluene 3NT, 4-nitrotoluene 4NT, nitrobenzene NB and 2-nitrobenzoic acid 2NBA as carbon and nitrogen source, resulting in their detoxification. The metabolism involved reductive transformation of nitroaromatics to the corresponding amines followed by cleavage of amino group to release ammonia. Cell free extract showed nitroreductase activity in the range of 310-389 units/mg. NB was reduced to form benzamine and 4-aminophenol, 2NT was reduced to 2-aminotoluene, whereas 2NBA was reduced to form 2-aminobenzoic acid. Similarly, 3NT was metabolized to 3-aminotoluene and 2-amino-4-methylphenol, while 4NT was reduced to 4-nitrosotoluene and 4-aminotoluene. Cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays using Jurkat cell line, and Ames test were used to evaluate the detoxification of nitroaromatics during biodegradation. Biodegradation with Cupriavidus resulted in 2.6-11 fold increase in cell viability, 1.3-2.3 fold reduction in apoptosis, 1.6-55 fold reduction in caspase-3 activation, and complete disappearance of mutagenic activity. In soil microcosm, bioaugmentation with Cupriavidus resulted in 16-59 degradation of various nitroaromatics, as against lt14 degradation without bioaugmentation. Thus, the present study reflects promising capability of Cupriavidus strain a3 in degradation and detoxification of multiple nitroaromatics."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion MPP, a neurotoxin selective to dopaminergic neurons and an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I, has been widely used as an etiologic model of Parkinsons disease. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of a novel synthetic compound, 8-Phenyl-6a,7,8,9,9a,10-hexahydro-6H-isoindolo5,6-gquinoxaline-7,9-dione PHID, on MPP-induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. MPP induced apoptosis characterized by generation of reactive oxygen species, caspase-3 activation, poly ADP ribose polymerase proteolysis and increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio were blocked by PHID in a dose-dependent fashion. Furthermore, MPP-mediated activation of stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK was also inhibited by PHID in a dose-dependent manner. The results indicate that PHID protects against MPP-induced apoptosis by blocking reactive oxygen species stimulation and JNK signaling pathways in SH-SY5Y cells, implicating the novel compound in the prevention of progressive neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinsons disease."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Recent findings have reported that up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha TNF- induced by myocardial hypoxia aggravates cardiomyocyte injury. Acetylcholine ACh, the principle vagal neurotransmitter, protects cardiomyocytes against hypoxia by inhibiting apoptosis. However, it is still unclear whether ACh regulates TNF- production in cardiomyocytes after hypoxia. The concentration of extracellular TNF- was increased in a time-dependent manner during hypoxia. Furthermore, ACh treatment also inhibited hypoxia-induced TNF- mRNA and protein expression, caspase-3 activation, cell death and the production of reactive oxygen species ROS in cardiomyocytes. ACh treatment prevented the hypoxia-induced increase in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK phosphorylation, and increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK phosphorylation. Co-treatment with atropine, a non-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, or methoctramine, a selective type-2 muscarinic acetylcholine M2 receptor antagonist, abrogated the effects of ACh treatment in hypoxic cardiomyocytes. Co-treatment with hexamethonium, a non-selective nicotinic receptor antagonist, and methyllycaconitine, a selective alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, had no effect on ACh-treated hypoxic cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that ACh activates the M2 receptor, leading to regulation of MAPKs phosphorylation and, subsequently, down-regulation of TNF- production. We have identified a novel pathway by which ACh mediates cardioprotection against hypoxic injury in cardiomyocytes."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",EGFR signaling pathway,"Renal cell carcinoma RCC is one of the most common urological malignancies occurring in adult human kidneys worldwide. Recent research on antitumor drugs has focused on plant extracts, a class of compounds that play critical roles in cancer treatment. The present study aimed to investigate the potential antitumor effect of ginkgolic acid GA in RCC. Transwell invasion assay, cell counting kit-8 assay and flow cytometry were used to measure cell migration, cell viability and apoptosis, respectively. A network pharmacology approach was applied to identify pathway information, combining molecular docking techniques to screen for key target information. In the present study, GA inhibited the viability and proliferation of RCC cells 786-O and A498, both in vitro and in vivo, via G1 arrest. GA also reduced RCC cell invasion and migration. In addition, the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR was identified as a critical target protein of GA, which significantly inactivated EGFR signaling in RCC Plt0.05. Collectively, the present study provided evidence that GA exerts its anticancer function by directly targeting the EGFR signaling pathway, revealing the potential of GA therapy for RCC."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",PPARgamma activation,"Systemic inflammatory activity has turned out to play a key pathogenic role in vascular atherosclerosis, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Inflammatory biomarkers may therefore be a valuable tool for risk evaluation. Among them, the best evidence to date supports the use of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein hs-CRP to monitor insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk in diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. Data suggest that hs-CRP may also participate directly in the process of atherogenesis. A growing number of clinical trials tested the hypothesis that antidiabetic drugs specifically targeting insulin resistance could benefit individuals by reducing inflammation, atherogenesis, and thus cardiovascular risk. One such class are the thiazolidinediones pioglitazone and rosiglitazone. These agents act as selective ligands of the nuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma PPARgamma. This article reviewed published data on hs-CRP changes with the thiazolidinedione agent pioglitazone. Here we found pronounced insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory properties in different clinical settings, including diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. Coadministration of pioglitazone to antilipidemic statin therapy resulted in additional effects on low-grade inflammation, and hs-CRP reduction has been demonstrated to occur independently of glucose lowering. The anti-inflammatory effect appeared to be a rapid physiologic reaction on PPARgamma activation and could be observed within a short-term interval after starting pioglitazone therapy. In summary, clinical study results underline the benefit of an early insulin resistance treatment to oppose systemic vascular inflammation and cardiometabolic syndrome in patients with elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Although it is conventionally regarded as an inflammatory caspase, recent studies have shown that caspase-4 plays a role in induction of apoptosis by endoplasmic reticulum ER stress. We report here that activation of caspase-4 is also involved in induction of apoptosis by TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand TRAIL in human melanoma cells. Treatment with TRAIL resulted in activation of caspase-4. This appeared to be mediated by caspase-3, in that caspase-4 was activated later than caspase-8, -9, and -3, and that inhibition of caspase-3 blocked TRAIL-induced caspase-4 activation. Notably, TRAIL triggered ER stress in melanoma cells as shown by up-regulation of the GRP78 protein and the spliced form of XBP-1 mRNA. This seemed to be necessary for activation of caspase-4, as activation of caspase-3 by agents that did not trigger ER stress did not cause activation of caspase-4. Importantly, inhibition of caspase-4 also partially blocked caspase-3 activation, suggesting that activation of caspase-4 may be positive feed-back mechanism to further enhance caspase-3 activation. Collectively, these results show that activation of caspase-4 contributes to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and is associated with induction of ER stress by TRAIL in melanoma cells, and may have important implications for improving therapeutic efficacies of TRAIL in melanoma."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"AIM To investigate whether the apoptotic activities of 8-bromo-7-methoxychrysin BrMC involve reactive oxygen species ROS generation and c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK activation in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells HCC.   METHODS HepG2, Bel-7402 and L-02 cell lines were cultured in vitro and the apoptotic effects of BrMC were evaluated by flow cytometry FCM after propidium iodide PI staining, caspase-3 activity using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ELISA, and DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. ROS production was evaluated by FCM after dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate DCHF-DA probe labeling. The phosphorylation level of JNK and c-Jun protein was analyzed by Western blotting.   RESULTS FCM after PI staining showed a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of the sub-G1 cell population P lt 0.05, reaching 39.0 /- 2.8 of HepG2 cells after 48 h of treatment with BrMC at 10 micromol/L. The potency of BrMC to HepG2 and Bel-7402 32.1 /- 2.6 cells was found to be more effective than the lead compound, chrysin 16.2 /- 1.6 for HepG2 cells and 11.0 /- 1.3 for Bel-7402 cell at 40 micromol/L and similar to 5-fluorouracil 33.0 /- 2.1 for HepG2 cells and 29.3 /- 2.3 for Bel-7402 cells at 10 micromol/L. BrMC had little effect on human embryo liver L-02 cells, with the percentage of sub-G1 cell population 5.4 /- 1.8. Treatment of HepG2 cells with BrMC for 48 h also increased the levels of active caspase-3, in a concentration-dependent manner. z-DEVD-fmk, a caspase-3-specific inhibitor, prevented the activation of caspase-3. Treatment with BrMC at 10 micromol/L for 48 h resulted in the formation of a DNA ladder. Treatment of cells with BrMC 10 micromol/L increased mean fluorescence intensity of DCHF-DA in HepG2 cells from 7.2 /- 1.12 at 0 h to 79.8 /- 3.9 at 3 h and 89.7 /- 4.7 at 6 h. BrMC did not affect ROS generation in L-02 cells. BrMC treatment failed to induce cell death and caspase-3 activation in HepG2 cells pretreated with N-acetylcysteine 10 mmol/L. In addition, in HepG2 cells treated with BrMC 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 micromol/L for 12 h, JNK activation was observed. Peak JNK activation occurred at 12 h post-treatment and this activation persisted for up to 24 h. The expression of phosphorylated JNK and c-Jun protein after 12 h with BrMC-treated cells was inhibited by N-acetylcysteine and SP600125 pre-treatment, but GW9662 had no effect. SP600125 substantially reduced BrMC-induced cell death and caspase-3 activation of HepG2 cells. N-acetylcysteine and GW9662 also attenuated induction of cell death and caspase-3 activation in HepG2 cells treated with BrMC.   CONCLUSION BrMC induces apoptosis of HCC cells by ROS generation and sustained JNK activation."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",EGFR signaling pathway,"Glioblastoma GBM is characterized by severe hypoxic and acidic stress in an abnormal microenvironment. Monocarboxylate transporter MCT4, a pH-regulating protein, plays an important role in pH homeostasis of the glycolytic metabolic pathways in cancer cells. The present study showed that GBM exposure to hypoxic conditions increased MCT4 expression. We further analyzed the glioma patient database and found that MCT4 was significantly overexpressed in patients with GBM, and the MCT4 levels positively correlated with the clinico-pathological grades of gliomas. We further found that MCT4 knockdown abolished the hypoxia-enhanced of GBM cell motility and monocyte adhesion. However, the overexpression of MCT4 promoted GBM cell migration and monocyte adhesion activity. Our results also revealed that MCT4-regulated GBM cell motility and monocyte adhesion are mediated by activation of the serine/threonine-specific protein kinase AKT, focal adhesion kinase FAK, and epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR signaling pathways. Moreover, hypoxia mediated the acetylated signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT3 expression and regulated the transcriptional activity of hypoxia inducible factor HIF-1 in GBM cell lines. In a GBM mouse model, MCT4 was significantly increased in the tumor necrotic tissues. These findings raise the possibility for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting MCT4."

The homoisoflavonoids were then evaluated as AChE inhibitors and neurite outgrowth promoters. The catechol structure of the homoisoflavan B rings was important for AChE inhibition, and some of the homoisoflavonoids significantly promoted neurite outgrowth induced by nerve growth factor NGF."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"Cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 is implicated in the development of chronic inflammatory diseases. Recently, pyridazine derivatives have emerged as a novel prototype to develop COX-2 inhibitors. Accordingly, some pyridazine-based COX-2 inhibitors are reported herein. The reaction of aldehyde 3 and different hydrazines yielded the corresponding hydrazones. The hydrazones were further derivatized to the title compounds, which were assessed for COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitory action, gastric ulcerogenic effects, and lipid peroxidation properties. Molecular docking studies and determination of the physicochemical parameters were also carried out. The allocated structures of the reported compounds were coherent with their spectroscopic data. The compounds 9a IC50 = 15.50 nM, 114.77, 9b IC50 = 17.50 nM, 101.65, 12 IC50 = 17.10 nM, 104.03, 16b IC50 = 16.90 nM, 105.26, and 17 IC50 = 17.70 nM, 100.5 displayed better COX-2 inhibition than celecoxib IC50 = 17.79 nM, 100. These outcomes were harmonious with the molecular docking studies of 9a, 9b, 12, 16b, and 17. These compounds also displayed comparable onset and the duration of action concerning celecoxib and indomethacin in the in vivo studies. No ulcerogenic effects were observed for 9a and 12, whereas 9b, 16b, and 17 showed an insignificant ulcerogenic effect compared to celecoxib. The compounds 9a, 9b, 12, 16b, and 17 displayed a better lipid peroxidation profile than celecoxib and indomethacin. The compounds 9a ABS = 84.09, 9b ABS = 84.09, 12 ABS = 66.87, 16b ABS = 75.02, and 17 ABS = 81.42 also displayed appreciable calculated absorption compared to celecoxib ABS = 82.09. The compounds 9a, 9b, 11, 16b, and 17 have been recognized and postulated as non-ulcerogenic COX-2 inhibitors with promising physicochemical parameters and gastric safety profile. These compounds may be useful candidates to combat diseases caused by higher levels of COX-2."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND The popularity of fermented foods such as kefir, kuniss, and tofu has been greatly increasing over the past several decades, and the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticancer effects has recently become the focus of research. While we have recently demonstrated the ability of the novel kefir product PFT Probiotics Fermentation Technology to exert anticancer effects in vitro, here we demonstrate its ability to inhibit Ehrlich ascites carcinoma EAC in mice.   METHODS Mice were inoculated intramuscularly with EAC cells to develop solid tumors. PFT was administered orally 2 g/kg/day to mice 6 days/week, either 2 days before tumor cell inoculation or 9 days after inoculation to mice bearing solid tumors. Tumor growth, blood lymphocyte levels, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, apoptotic regulator expression, TNF- expression, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential MMP, PCNA, and CD4 and CD8 T cells in tumor cells were quantitatively evaluated by flow cytometry or RT-PCR. Further studies in vitro were carried out where EAC cells along with several other human cancer cell lines were cultured in the presence of PFT 0-5 mg/mL. Percent cell viability and IC50 was estimated by MTT assay.   RESULTS Our data shows that PFT exerts the following 1 inhibition of tumor incidence and tumor growth 2 inhibition of cellular proliferation via a marked decrease in the expression of tumor marker PCNA 3 arrest of the tumor cell cycle in the sub-G0/G1 phase, signifying apoptosis 4 induction of apoptosis in cancer cells via a mitochondrial-dependent pathway as indicated by the up-regulation of p53 expression, increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, decrease in the polarization of MMP, and caspase-3 activation and 5 immunomodulation with an increase in the number of infiltrating CD4 and CD8 T cells and an enhancement of TNF- expression within the tumor.   CONCLUSIONS PFT reduces tumor incidence and tumor growth in mice with EAC by inducing apoptosis in EAC cells via the mitochondrial-dependent pathway, suppressing cancer cell proliferation, and stimulating the immune system. PFT may be a useful agent for cancer prevention."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"PURPOSE To determine what caspases are activated during staurosporin-induced apoptosis in cultured bovine lens epithelial cells BLECs, to study the time course of caspase activation in relation to morphologic changes, and to investigate the effect of caspase and/or proteasome inhibition on apoptosis.   METHODS BLECs were incubated with staurosporin at different concentrations or for different times. Phosphatidylserine PS externalization was detected by annexin-V labeling, nuclear morphology was studied by staining with Hoechst 33342 stain Hoechst, Frankfurt, Germany, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by the TdT-dUTP terminal nick-end labeling TUNEL assay. The activity of caspase-1, -2, -3, -4, -8, and -9 as well as the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome was measured by the use of fluorogenic peptide substrates. Inhibition of the proteasome was performed by incubation with 10 microM lactacystin, and caspases were inhibited by 1 microM Z-DEVD-FMK or 20 microM Z-VAD-FMK.   RESULTS Staurosporin treatment caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in the number of apoptotic cells and in caspase-3 activity. Activation of caspase-2, -4, -8, and -9 was also seen. Caspase activity was increased after 3 hours incubation with 1 microM staurosporin, which is also the time when most cells became annexin-V-positive. Nuclear changes indicative of apoptosis, viewed with both Hoechst and TUNEL staining, appeared after 4 to 6 hours of staurosporin incubation. Incubation of BLECs with lactacystin caused reduction of proteasome activity and increased apoptosis, evidenced in both the TUNEL assay and caspase-3 activation. Preincubation of lens epithelial cells with caspase inhibitors caused complete inhibition of lactacystin- or staurosporin-induced caspase-3 activation Z-DEVD-FMK/Z-VAD-FMK and also of caspase-2, -4, -8, and -9 Z-VAD-FMK, but the reduction in TUNEL-positive cells was only partial. PS translocation and DNA fragmentation after staurosporin treatment occurred despite complete caspase blockade.   CONCLUSIONS Staurosporin-induced apoptosis in BLECs involves activation of several caspases. Inhibition of the proteasome causes caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. Both staurosporin- and lactacystin-induced apoptosis can be executed in a caspase-independent manner. The present data are useful for understanding of proteolytic mechanisms during apoptosis in lens epithelial cells, which may be an important event in normal lens development as well as in some types of cataract."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Doxorubicin DOX administration decreases cardiac soluble guanylate cyclase sGC activity. We hypothesized that bypassing impaired NO-sGC-cGMP pathway resulting from the activation of oxidized and heme-free soluble guanylate cyclase sGC could be a therapeutic target for DOX-mediated cardiomyopathy DOX-CM. The present study investigated the therapeutic roles and mechanism of BAY60-2770, an activator of oxidized sGC, in alleviating DOX-CM.   METHODS H9c2 cardiomyocytes were pretreated with BAY60-2770 followed by DOX. Cell viability and intracellular reactive oxygen species ROS were subsequently measured. To determine the role BAY60-2770 in mitochondrial ROS generation and mitochondrial membrane potential, we examined mitoSOX RED and TMRE fluorescence under DOX exposure. As animal experiments, rats were orally administered with 5 mg/kg of BAY60-2770 at 1 h prior to every DOX treatment and then assessed by echocardiography and apoptotic marker and autophagy.   RESULTS BAY60-2770 ameliorated cell viability and DOX-induced oxidative stress in H9c2 cells, which was mediated by PKG activation. Mitochondrial ROS and TMRE fluorescence were attenuated by BAY60-2770 in DOX-treated H9c2 cells. DOX-induced caspase-3 activation decreased after pretreatment with BAY60-2770 in vivo and in vitro. Echocardiography showed that BAY60-2770 significantly improved DOX-induced myocardial dysfunction. Autophagosome was increased by BAY60-2770 in vivo.   CONCLUSIONS BAY60-2770 appears to mitigate DOX-induced mitochondrial ROS, membrane potential loss, autophagy, and subsequent apoptosis, leading to protection of myocardial injury and dysfunction. These novel results highlighted the therapeutic potential of BAY60-2770 in preventing DOX-CM."

Mussels were exposed for up to 48 hours to a mixture of copper Cu2, 400 microg L-1 and cadmium Cd2, 200 microg L-1, to dichlorvos DDVP, 100 microg L-1, and to carbaryl 100 microg L-1 at two temperatures 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C. Samples were collected after 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours of exposure, and AChE activity and metal concentration where applicable were analysed in gills, digestive gland, mantlemuscles, and the whole soft tissue. Very strong AChE inhibition was observed in response to the dichlorvos treatment, mainly in gills. Carbaryl and the metals caused a short-term inhibition effect. Considerable differences in AChE activity between the two temperatures were noticed. In particular, the metals were accumulated much faster at 20 degrees C than at 5 degrees C, especially in gills. No correlation between AChE activity and metal concentration was found. Gills turned out to be the optimal tissue for AChE activity analysis in short-term studies."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"We evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of SNAH in lipopolysaccharide LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages by performing nitric oxide NO assays, cytokine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, Western blotting, and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. SNAH inhibited the production of NO nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species ROS, tumor necrosis factor TNF-, and interleukin IL-6. Additionally, 100 M SNAH significantly inhibited total NO and ROS inhibitory activity by 93 p lt 0.001 and 34 p lt 0.05, respectively. Protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS and cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 stimulated by LPS were also decreased by SNAH. Moreover, SNAH significantly p lt 0.001 downregulated the TNF-, IL-6, and iNOS mRNA expression upon LPS stimulation. In addition, 3-100 M SNAH was not cytotoxic. Docking simulations and enzyme inhibitory assays with COX-2 revealed binding scores of -6.4 kcal/mol IC50 = 47.8 M with SNAH compared to -11.1 kcal/mol IC50 = 0.45 M with celecoxib, a known selective COX-2 inhibitor. Our results demonstrate that SNAH exerts anti-inflammatory effects via suppression of ROS and NO by COX-2 inhibition. Thus, SNAH may be useful as a pharmacological agent for treating inflammation-related diseases."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"A series of benzylamino inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase AChE have been designed based on a working hypothesis of the enzyme s active site. These compounds were tested for their inhibitory activities on AChE and potent inhibitors were further evaluated in terms of central selectivity. These studies led to a discovery of 3-1-phenylmethyl-4-piperidinyl-1-2,3,4, 5-tetrahydro-1H-1-benzazepin-8-yl-1-propanone fumarate TAK-147. Pharmacokinetic study has shown that the compound has high central selectivity, as demonstrated by rapid elimination from plasma and long-term existence in the brain. As a consequence, TAK-147 ameliorates impairments of learning and memory in various animal models without producing peripheral side effects. TAK-147 also activates the monoaminergic systems and energy metabolism. Furthermore, TAK-147 was revealed to have NGF-like neurotrophic activity on central cholinergic neurons at concentrations where it inhibits AChE activity. Therefore, TAK-147 is expected not only to ameliorate the clinical symptoms in Alzheimer s disease via AChE inhibition but to prevent or slow the progression of the disease via its neurotrophic action. TAK-147 is now under clinical trial as a therapeutic drug for Alzheimer s disease. This article reviews design and structure-activity relationships of TAK-147 and related compounds. Preclinical pharmacology of TAK-147 is also summarized."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",estrogen receptor activity,"PURPOSE Combination estrogen  progestin therapy has been associated with increased breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women. Selective estrogen receptor modulators SERM are potential alternatives to progestins, although the endometrial safety of estrogen  SERM co-therapies is not known. The goal of this study was to evaluate the endometrial profile of low-dose estradiol and the SERM tamoxifen alone and in combination.   EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Twenty-four postmenopausal female cynomolgus macaques were randomized by social group to receive placebo, low-dose micronized estradiol E2 0.25 mg/1,800 kcal, the SERM tamoxifen Tam 20 mg/1,800 kcal, or E2  Tam for 4 months in a parallel-arm design.   RESULTS Tamoxifen alone resulted in overlapping but distinct effects compared with E2. Both E2 and Tam increased uterine weight and endometrial thickness, whereas only E2 increased endometrial proliferation. Morphologic effects were similar for Tam and E2  Tam, which both induced stromal fibrosis and cystic change. Tamoxifen inhibited E2-induced proliferation and expression of genes related to cell cycle progression while exhibiting mixed agonist and antagonist effects on gene markers of estrogen receptor activity. The gene expression profile for E2  Tam was distinct from either E2 or Tam alone but dominated by the Tam effect for estrogen-regulated genes. Tam also attenuated E2 effects on both vaginal maturation and cervical epithelial height.   CONCLUSIONS These findings characterize a novel phenotype resulting from estrogen  SERM co-therapy. The predominance of Tam effects on endometrial proliferation, morphology, and transcriptional profiles suggests that endometrial risks for E2  Tam may be similar to Tam alone."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAID are among the most widely prescribed medications worldwide. While these agents are efficacious for the relief of both pain and the signs and symptoms of inflammation, the use of traditional NSAID is associated with a high prevalence of toxic events. It is estimated that 2-4 of traditional NSAID users will have a serious adverse gastrointestinal GI event per year, with a point prevalence of GI ulcers at any given time of 10-30. The mortality rate associated with these NSAID is one of the highest attributed to the use of any agent. Prostaglandin replacement with misoprostol has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of serious GI toxicity related to the use of conventional NSAID. All conventional NSAID inhibit both cyclooxygenase-1 COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. As COX-1 is constitutively expressed in many tissues and contributes to the maintenance of the normal physiologic state in the GI tract, the kidney, and platelets, an agent that specifically inhibits COX-2, an inducible enzyme associated with the inflammatory response, would be highly desirable. Specific COX-2 inhibition would have the advantage of improving the signs and symptoms of inflammation, while avoiding the possibly significant toxicity of traditional NSAID. This article describes the biology of eicosanoids and the effects of NSAID, the toxicity profile of conventional NSAID, and the rationale for the use of gastroprotective agents or agents that specifically inhibit the COX-2 isozyme."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Oxidants such as H2O2 can induce a low level of apoptosis at low concentrations but at higher concentrations cause necrosis. Higher concentrations of H2O2 also inhibit the induction of apoptosis by chemotherapy drugs. One theory is that, at higher concentrations, H2O2 causes direct oxidative inactivation of caspase-3 activity, thus preventing the apoptotic pathway from being used. We find that treatment of recombinant caspase-3 with H2O2 can partially reduce its enzymatic activity However, the following findings show that this does not occur in the cell. 1 The inhibition by H2O2 of VP-16-induced apoptosis and cellular caspase-3 activity can be overcome by adding inhibitors of polyADP-ribose polymerase PARP at sub-stoichiometric concentrations. 2 Delayed addition of H2O2 to VP-16-treated cells prevents additional caspase induction but does not inhibit the caspase activity that has already been generated. 3 H2O2 is a poor inhibitor of caspase-3 activity in cell lysates. 4 Addition of H2O2 to cells inhibits activation of caspase-9, which is required for activation of caspase-3. We conclude that inhibition of caspase-3 activity in the cell occurs indirectly at a step located upstream of caspase-3 activation. H2O2 acts in part by inducing DNA strand breaks and activating PARP, thus depleting the cells of ATP. When this pathway is blocked, even high concentrations of H2O2 can induce caspase-9 and -3 activation and cause apoptosis."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Temefos and six of its metabolites were tested for their capacity to inhibit the in vitro activity of brain acetylcholinesterase AChE of Fundulus heteroclitus. While temefos was not inhibitory at levels up to 10.7 mM in brain homogenate samples, its metabolites were active within the range of 2 X 10-4mM to 1.26 mM in causing a 50 reduction in the enzyme activity. Exposure of F. heteroclitus to temefos under laboratory conditions caused a reduction in AChE activity, which was proportional to the pesticide concentration and the exposure period. Visible symptoms of organophosphate poisoning were apparent only after the AChE inhibition reached 80. F. heteroclitus and Cyprinidon variegatus exposed to 10 biweekly applications of temefos granules in the field showed no inhibition of brain AChE. However, exposure of F. heteroclitus to biweekly applications four of temefos emulsion caused a reduction in the enzyme 50, but only in the pre-third application samples. A gradual increase in brain AChE occurred both in F. heteroclitus and C. variegatus as the season progressed from April to October."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"Twenty benzothiazole derivatives bearing a 1,3,4-oxadiazole moiety were synthesized and evaluated for their anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Among these compounds, 8h and 8l were appeared to have high radical scavenging efficacies as 0.05  0.02 and 0.07  0.03 mmol/L of IC50 values in ABTS bioassay, respectively. In anti-inflammatory tests, compound 8h displayed good activity with 57.35 inhibition after intraperitoneal administration, which was more potent than the reference drug indomethacin. Molecular modeling studies were performed to investigate the binding mode of the representative compound 8h into COX-2 enzyme. In vitro enzyme study implied that compound 8h exerted its anti-inflammatory activity through COX-2 inhibition."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"During the last decade, the one drug-one target strategy has resulted to be inefficient in facing diseases with complex ethiology like Alzheimers disease and many others. In this context, the multitarget paradigm has emerged as a promising strategy. Based on this consideration, we aim to develop novel molecules as promiscuous ligands acting in two or more targets at the same time. For such purpose, a new series of indolylpropyl-piperazinyl oxoethyl-benzamido piperazines were synthesized and evaluated as multitarget-directed drugs for the serotonin transporter SERT and acetylcholinesterase AChE. The ability to decrease -amyloid levels as well as cell toxicity of all compounds were also measured. In vitro results showed that at least four compounds displayed promising activity against SERT and AChE. Compounds 18 and 19 IC50 = 3.4 and 3.6 M respectively exhibited AChE inhibition profile in the same order of magnitude as donepezil DPZ, IC50 = 2.17 M, also displaying nanomolar affinity in SERT. Moreover, compounds 17 and 24 displayed high SERT affinities IC50 = 9.2 and 1.9 nM respectively similar to the antidepressant citalopram, and significant micromolar AChE activity at the same time. All the bioactive compounds showed a low toxicity profile in the range of concentrations studied. Molecular docking allowed us to rationalize the binding mode of the synthesized compounds in both targets. In addition, we also show that compounds 11 and 25 exhibit significant -amyloid lowering activity in a cell-based assay, 11 50 inhibition, 10 M and 25 35 inhibition, 10 M. These results suggest that indolylpropyl benzamidopiperazines based compounds constitute promising leads for a multitargeted approach for Alzheimers disease."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Fibrillar amyloid beta Abeta peptides are major constituents of senile plaques in Alzheimer disease AD brain and cause neuronal apoptosis in vitro. Bax and caspase-3 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD and are components of a well-defined molecular pathway of neuronal apoptosis. To determine whether Abeta-induced neuronal apoptosis involves bax and/or caspase-3 activation, we examined the effect of Abeta on wild-type, bax-deficient, and caspase-3-deficient telencephalic neurons in vitro. In wild-type cultures, Abeta produced time- and concentration-dependent caspase-3 activation, apoptotic nuclear changes, and neuronal death. These neurotoxic effects of Abeta were not observed in bax-deficient cultures. Caspase-3 deficiency, or pharmacological inhibition of caspase activity, prevented caspase-3 activation and blocked the appearance of apoptotic nuclear features but not Abeta-induced neuronal death. Neither calpain inhibition nor microtubule stabilization with Taxol protected telencephalic neurons from Abeta-induced caspase activation or apoptosis. These results have potential implications regarding the underlying pathophysiology of AD and towards AD treatment strategies."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"A novel series of aromatic esters 1a-1m related to the Amaryllidaceae alkaloid AA haemanthamine were designed, synthesized and tested in vitro with particular emphasis on the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Some of the synthesized compounds revealed promising acetylcholinesterase AChE and butyrylcholinesterase BuChE inhibitory profile. Significant human AChE hAChE inhibition was demonstrated by 11-O-3-nitrobenzoylhaemanthamine 1j with IC50value of 4.0  0.3 M. The strongest human BuChE hBuChE inhibition generated 1-O-2-methoxybenzoylhaemanthamine 1g with IC50 value 3.3  0.4 M. Moreover, 11-O-2-chlorbenzoylhaemanthamine 1m was able to inhibit both enzymes in dose-dependent manner. The mode of hAChE and hBuChE inhibition was minutely inspected using enzyme kinetic analysis in tandem with in silico experiments, the latter elucidating crucial interaction in 1j-, 1m-hAChE and 1g-, 1m-hBuChE complexes. The blood-brain barrier BBB permeability was investigated applying the parallel artificial membrane permeation assay PAMPA to predict the CNS availability of the compounds."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Caspase-3 is an effector of apoptosis in experimental models of Parkinsons disease PD. However, its potential role in the human pathology remains to be demonstrated. Using caspase-3 immunohistochemistry on the postmortem human brain, we observed a positive correlation between the degree of neuronal loss in dopaminergic DA cell groups affected in the mesencephalon of PD patients and the percentage of caspase-3-positive neurons in these cell groups in control subjects and a significant decrease of caspase-3-positive pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of PD patients compared with controls that also could be observed in an animal model of PD. This suggests that neurons expressing caspase-3 are more sensitive to the pathological process than those that do not express the protein. In addition, using an antibody raised against activated caspase-3, the percentage of active caspase-3-positive neurons among DA neurons was significantly higher in PD patients than in controls. Finally, electron microscopy analysis in the human brain and in vitro data suggest that caspase-3 activation precedes and is not a consequence of apoptotic cell death in PD."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"UNLABELLED The aim of this study was to investigate the apoptosis resulting from NSC 95397, brefeldin A, bortezomib and sanguinarine in neuroendocrine tumor cell lines.   MATERIALS AND METHODS A multiparametric high-content screening assay for measurement of apoptosis was used. The human pancreatic carcinoid cell line, BON-1, human typical bronchial carcinoid cell line NCI-H727 and the human atypical bronchial carcinoid cell line NCI-H720 were tested. After incubation with cytotoxic drugs, the DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33342, fluorescein-tagged probes that covalently bind active caspase-3 and chloromethyl-X-rosamine to detect mitochondrial membrane potential were added. Image acquisition and quantitative measurement of fluorescence was performed using automated image capture and analysis instrument ArrayScan. In addition, nuclear morphology was examined on microscopic slides stained with May-Grunewald-Giemsa.   RESULTS A time- and dose-dependent activation of caspase-3 and increase in nuclear fragmentation and condensation were observed for the drugs using a multiparametric apoptosis assay. These results were confirmed with nuclear morphological examination on microscopic slides.   CONCLUSION NSC 95397, brefeldin A, bortezomib and sanguinarine induced caspase-3 activation with modest changes in nuclear morphology."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 mTORC1 mTOR-raptor interaction and heat shock protein 70 Hsp70 regulate various cellular processes and are crucial for the progression of many cancers and metabolic diseases. In the recent study, we reported that interaction of Hsp70 with tuberous sclerosis complex 1 TSC1 regulated apoptosis. This study was designed to elucidate the underlying mechanism in Cos-1 cells. Here, we show that N-formyl-3,4-methylenedioxy-benzylidene-gamma-butyrolaetam KNK437, which inhibits the expression level of Hsp70, abrogated phosphorylation of mTOR and S6K in response to insulin, and inhibited mTORC1 activity via disruption of an interaction between mTOR and raptor. In addition, KNK437 did not alter TSC1/2 complex formation. Furthermore, KNK437 inhibited the mTOR-raptor interaction on the outer membrane of the mitochondria and triggered caspase-3 activation. A reduction in the level of Hsp70 could result in the inhibition of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, thereby inducing apoptosis."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Considering the wide variety of effects that have been reported to occur in the developmental neurotoxicity of chlorpyrifos CP and the lack of consensus on their dependence of brain acetylcholinesterase AChE activity inhibition, we applied microarray technology to explore dose-dependent alterations in transcriptional response in the fetal and maternal C57BL/6 mouse brain after daily gestational exposure days 6 to 17 to CP 2, 4, 10, 12 or 15 mg/kg, sc. We identified significantly altered genes across doses and assessed for overrepresentation of Gene Ontology GO biological processes and KEGG pathways. We further clustered genes based on their expression profiles across doses and repeated the GO/pathways analysis for each cluster. The dose-effect relationship of CP on gene expression, both at the gene and pathway levels was non-monotonic and not necessarily related to brain AChE inhibition. The largest impact was observed in the 10mg/kg dose group which was also the LOAEL for brain AChE inhibition. In the maternal brain, lower doses 4 mg/kg influenced GO categories and pathways such as cell adhesion, behavior, lipid metabolism, long-term potentiation, nervous system development, neurogenesis, synaptic transmission. In the fetal brain, lower doses 2 and/or 4 mg/kg significantly altered cell division, translation, transmission of nerve impulse, chromatin modification, long-term potentiation. In addition, some genes involved in nervous system development and signaling were shown to be specifically influenced by these lower CP doses. Our approach was sensitive and reflected the diversity of responses known to be disrupted by CP and highlighted possible additional consequences of CP neurotoxicity, such as disturbance of the ubiquitin proteasome system."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"PURPOSE This study aimed to investigate the role of cathepsin B dependent autophagy induced by chronic aerobic exercise on a high-fat diet HFD-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis NASH in rats.   METHODS Healthy female Sprague-Dawley SD rats 8-10 weeks old 180g-200g n=6 per group were divided into 1 control group 2 HFD group 3 Exercise group 4 HFD  exercise group. Rats were fed with a normal chow or an HFD for 12 weeks. Rats with exercise ran on a rotarod for 30 min per day from weeks 9-12.   RESULTS Exercise training significantly 1 upregulated the levels of autophagy markers Beclin1, ATG5 and LC3II partly through inhibiting the p-AKT/mTOR pathway 2 ameliorated HFD-mediated accumulation of fat mass by upregulating -oxidation regulator PPAR- and downregulating fatty acid synthesis marker SREBP-1c via lipophagy 3 diminished the HFD-induced hepatic pro-inflammatory mediators TNF- and IL-1 via NF-B inactivation 4 decreased the NASH-induced hepatic apoptotic marker caspase-3 activation caused by the upstream oxidative stress and by cytochrome P450 2E1 CYP2E1 5 mitigated the HFD-mediated lysosomal membrane permeabilisation and cathepsin B release partly via the reduction of reactive oxygen species ROS.   CONCLUSIONS Chronic aerobic exercise reduces oxidative stress/ROS and ROS may cause lysosomal membrane destabilisation and disrupts the autophagic process. The beneficial effect of chronic exercise may further inhibit the process of lysosome membrane permeabilisation and facilitate lysosome fusion with autophagosomes to trigger autophagy. This process may possibly contribute to the inhibition of cathepsin B released into cytosol which further reduces inflammation and mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"Many human cancers express elevated levels of cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2, an enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of prostaglandins. Available clinical data establish the protective effect of COX-2 inhibition on human cancer progression. However, despite these encouraging outcomes, the appearance of unwanted side effects remains a major hurdle for the general application of COX-2 inhibitors as effective cancer drugs. Hence, a better understanding of the molecular signals downstream of COX-2 is needed for the elucidation of drug targets that may improve cancer therapy. Here, we show that the COX-2 product prostaglandin E2 PGE2 acts on cognate receptor EP4 to promote the migration of A549 lung cancer cells. Treatment with PGE2 enhances tyrosine kinase c-Src activation, and blockade of c-Src activity represses the PGE2-mediated lung cancer cell migration. PGE2 affects target cells by activating four receptors named EP1 to EP4. Use of EP subtype-selective ligand agonists suggested that EP4 mediates prostaglandin-induced A549 lung cancer cell migration, and this conclusion was confirmed using a short hairpin RNA approach to specifically knock down EP4 expression. Proximal EP4 effectors include heterotrimeric Gs and betaArrestin proteins. Knockdown of betaArrestin1 expression with shRNA significantly impaired the PGE2-induced c-Src activation and cell migration. Together, these results support the idea that increased expression of the COX-2 product PGE2 in the lung tumor microenvironment may initiate a mitogenic signaling cascade composed of EP4, betaArrestin1, and c-Src which mediates cancer cell migration. Selective targeting of EP4 with a ligand antagonist may provide an efficient approach to better manage patients with advanced lung cancer."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"An artificial series of macrocycles based on 4,4-sulfonyldiphenol intermediate was synthesized using a multistep procedure involving oxidation of bisphenol sulfide, etherification of phenolic hydroxyl groups, and final ring closure with different diamines. Different chemical species having aromatic, heteroaromatic, and aliphatic characters were incorporated into macrocyclic frameworks in the final step of ring closure. This simple and easily executable synthetic strategy was applied to synthesize 15 macrocycles 5a-o in excellent yields. Characterization of the synthesized products was achieved through well-known modern spectroscopic techniques such as IR, NMR, and Mass. Macrocycles 5m and 5n were found to show significant AChE inhibition with IC50 values of 76.9  0.24 and 71.2  0.77 M, respectively. Macrocycle 5n was also found to be an active inhibitor of butyrylcholinesterase BChE with IC50 score of 55.3  0.54 M. Among others, macrocycle 5l cyclized with o-phenylenediamine demonstrated moderate inhibition with IC50 value of 81.1  0.54 M. Increasing interest in studying interactions of macrocycles with different enzymatic targets compelled us to design and synthesize sulfone-based macrocycles that might prove as highly potent class of biologically active compounds."

The most potent inhibitors M02 Ki = 5.4 M and M08 Ki = 0.53 M exhibit good selectivity against Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Compound M08 exhibits anti-proliferation activity and induces caspase-3 activation in Jurkat cancer cells.

"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancers in modern societies. Previous studies have shown that the use of nanoparticle complexes is effective in the treatment of cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the cytotoxicity and anticancer properties of cobalt oxide Co3O4 nanoparticles NPs functionalized by glutamic acid Glu and conjugated with thiosemicarbazide TSC on gastric cancer AGS cell line. First, the Co3O4Glu/TSC nanoparticles were synthesized via co-condensation reaction. Fourier-transform infrared FTIR, X-ray diffraction XRD, scanning electron microscopy SEM and energy dispersive X-ray EDX tests were performed for identifying the morphology, structure, size and functional groups of produced nanoparticles. MTT assay was also performed to evaluate cytotoxicity effect. Moreover, Annexin V/PI staining with flow cytometry analysis, caspase-3 activation assay, and Hoechst 33258 staining was carried out for evaluating apoptosis. The FTIR results showed that the components of Co3O4Glu/TSC NPs complex were successfully fabricated. Crystallographic structure of Co3O4Glu/TSC NPs was confirmed by XRD patterns. SEM results indicated that the size of the nanoparticles was in the range of 16-40 nm. An EDX spectrum was determined and data explained the existence of cobalt as the prominent element. MTT test results showed that AGS cell life was significantly decreased compared to the control group with increasing concentration of nanoparticles dose-dependent P lt 0.05, IC50 = 107.5 g/mL. The results of flow cytometry assay and caspase-3 activity showed that fabricated Co3O4Glu/TSC NPs induced apoptosis in the treated group. Moreover, Co3O4Glu/TSC NPs treated AGS cells indicate an increase in the apoptotic characteristics including nuclear fragmentation. In the current work, the promising cytotoxicity and anti-cancer activities of Co3O4Glu/TSC NPs complex toward gastric cancer AGS cell line were showed and it can be suggested for the drug delivery system."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",Sodium channel inhibition,"GS-967 and eleclazine GS-6615 are novel sodium channel inhibitors exhibiting antiarrhythmic effects in various in vitro and in vivo models. The antiarrhythmic mechanism has been attributed to preferential suppression of late sodium current I NaL. Here, we took advantage of a high throughput automated electrophysiology platform SyncroPatch 768PE to investigate the molecular pharmacology of GS-967 and eleclazine on peak sodium current I NaP recorded from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. We compared the effects of GS-967 and eleclazine with the antiarrhythmic drug lidocaine, the prototype I NaL inhibitor ranolazine, and the slow inactivation enhancing drug lacosamide. In human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, GS-967 and eleclazine caused a reduction of I NaP in a frequency-dependent manner consistent with use-dependent block UDB. GS-967 and eleclazine had similar efficacy but evoked more potent UDB of I NaP IC50 = 0.07 and 0.6 M, respectively than ranolazine 7.8 M, lidocaine 133.5 M, and lacosamide 158.5 M. In addition, GS-967 and eleclazine exerted more potent effects on slow inactivation and recovery from inactivation compared with the other sodium channel blocking drugs we tested. The greater UDB potency of GS-967 and eleclazine was attributed to the higher association rates and moderate unbinding rate of these two compounds with sodium channels. We propose that substantial UDB contributes to the observed antiarrhythmic efficacy of GS-967 and eleclazine. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We investigated the molecular pharmacology of GS-967 and eleclazine on sodium channels in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes using a high throughput automated electrophysiology platform. Sodium channel inhibition by GS-967 and eleclazine has unique effects, including accelerating the onset of slow inactivation and impairing recovery from inactivation. These effects combined with rapid binding and moderate unbinding kinetics explain potent use-dependent block, which we propose contributes to their observed antiarrhythmic efficacy."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"A new series of 1,4-diarylazetidin-2-one derivatives -lactams were designed and synthesized to evaluate their biological activities as selective cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 inhibitors. In vitro COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition studies showed that all compounds were selective inhibitors of the COX-2 isozyme with IC50 values in the 0.05-0.11 M range, and COX-2 selectivity indexes in the range of 170-703.7. Among the synthesized -lactams, 3-methoxy-4-4-methylsulfonylphenyl-1-3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylazetidin-2-one 4j possessing trimethoxy groups at the N-1 phenyl ring exhibited the highest COX-2 inhibitory selectivity and potency, even more potent than the reference drug celecoxib. The analgesic activity of the synthesized compounds was also determined using the formalin test. Compound 4f displayed the best analgesic activity among the synthesized molecules. Molecular modeling studies indicated that the methylsulfonyl pharmacophore group can be inserted into the secondary pocket of the COX-2 active site for interactions with Arg513 . The structure-activity data acquired indicate that the -lactam ring moiety constitutes a suitable scaffold to design new 1,4-diarylazetidin-2-ones with selective COX-2 inhibitory activity."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Past studies have indicated that the dysregulation of Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 ALDH2 is related to the pathogenesis of acute stroke. However, the underlying mechanisms of ALDH2-mediated acute stroke are still not well understood. Thus, our study was designed to explore the influence of ALDH2 in acute stroke and determine whether its related mechanisms are involved in regulating mitochondria-associated apoptosis modulating JNK/caspase-3 pathway. In vitro analysis on the gain and loss of ALDH2 and JNK function were performed to explore its influence on OGD/R injury and relevant signaling pathways. Our findings suggested that ALDH2 expression was significantly down-regulated in rats suffering from acute stroke and also in primary cortical cultured neurons and PC12 cells upon OGD/R stimulation. ALDH2 overexpression markedly decreased infarct size and improved neurological outcomes. Furthermore, ALDH2 overexpression significantly suppressed stroke-induced mitochondria-associated apoptosis and inhibited p-JNK activation and p-JNK/caspase-3 complex formation. Similarly, in in vitro OGD/R models, ALDH2 reintroduction not only promoted cellular viability and moderated LDH release, but also inhibited mitochondria-related apoptosis. Moreover, JNK inhibition relieved OGD/R-induced cellular injury and apoptosis while JNK activation aggravated them. Furthermore, ALDH2 overexpression and JNK inhibition significantly reduced caspase-3 activation and transcription which was triggered by OGD/R damage. Caspase-3 activation and transcription also re-elevated during activation of JNK in ALDH2-reintroduced cells. Finally, ChIP assay revealed that p-JNK was bound to caspase-3 promoter. Collectively, ALDH2 overexpression led to a significant reduction in mitochondria-related apoptosis via JNK-mediated caspase-3 activation and transcription in both in vitro and in vivo cerebral ischemia models."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Extracellular vesicles EVs released by different cell types play an important role in many physiological and pathophysiological processes. In physiological conditions, red blood cell RBC-derived EVs compose 4-8 of all circulating EVs, and oxidative stress OS as a consequence of different pathophysiological conditions significantly increases the amount of circulated RBC-derived EVs. However, the mechanisms of EV formation are not yet fully defined. To analyze OS-induced EV formation and RBC transformations, we used flow cytometry to evaluate cell esterase activity, caspase-3 activity, and band 3 clustering. Band 3 clustering was additionally analyzed by confocal microscopy. Two original laser diffraction-based approaches were used for the analysis of cell deformability and band 3 activity. Hemoglobin species were characterized spectrophotometrically. We showed that cell viability in tert-Butyl hydroperoxide-induced OS directly correlated with oxidant concentration to cell count ratio, and that RBC-derived EVs contained hemoglobin oxidized to hemichrome HbChr. OS induced caspase-3 activation and band 3 clustering in cells and EVs. Importantly, we showed that OS-induced EV formation is independent of calcium. The presented data indicated that during OS, RBCs eliminated HbChr by vesiculation in order to sacrifice the cell itself, thereby prolonging lifespan and delaying the untimely clearance of in all other respects healthy RBCs."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Mitochondria-related cell death pathways play a major role in ischemic brain injury. Thus, mitochondrial ""protective"" molecules could be considered for new therapeutic regimens. We recently reported that acute administration of docosahexaenoic acid DHA triglyceride lipid emulsion, immediately after hypoxic-ischemic HI insult, markedly attenuated brain infarct size. This was associated with an early change of DHA-derived specialized pro-resolving mediator SPM profiles. Specifically, DHA treatment induced a 50 increase of neuroprotectin D1 NPD1 levels in ischemic brain. Based on these findings, we questioned if direct administration of NPD1 after HI injury also affords neuroprotection, and if so, by what mechanisms. Using HI insult to mimic ischemic stroke in neonatal mice, we observed that acute intraperitoneal injection of NPD1 immediately after HI injury prevented the expansion of the ischemic core by 40 and improved coordination and motor abilities compared to the control group. At 7 days after HI injury, NPD1 treatment decreased ipsilateral hemisphere atrophy and preserved motor functions in wire-holding and bridge-crossing tests compared to control littermates. Brain mitochondria, isolated at 4 h after reperfusion from mice treated with NPD1, showed an increase in the capacity to buffer calcium after HI injury, as result of the preservation of mitochondrial membranes. Further, NPD1 induced a reduction of mitochondrial BAX translocation and oligomerization, attenuated cytochrome C release and decreased AIF nuclear translocation. To confirm whether NPD1 acts as BAX inhibitor, we evaluated NPD1 action co-administrated with a pro-apoptotic agent, staurosporine, using mouse embryonic fibroblasts as in vitro model of apoptosis. NPD1 exposure markedly decreased mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, blocking BAX translocation from cytosol to mitochondria and subsequently reducing caspase-3 activation. Our findings provide novel evidence that the neuroprotective action of NPD1 is elicited rapidly in the first few hours after ischemic injury and is associated with both preserved mitochondrial membrane structure and reduced BAX mitochondrial translocation and activation."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Volatile anesthetics such as isoflurane are widely used in clinical and research contexts. Concerns have been raised that the effects of these drugs on the central nervous system may result in long-term impairment after surgery or general anesthesia. Hence, this study aimed to detect how different isoflurane concentrations influence spatial learning and cell death in adult mice.   METHODS Fifty-two C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided in four groups. Mice in three groups were exposed to different concentrations of isoflurane 1, 1.5, and 2 for 1 h the control group was not exposed to anesthesia. Five mice per group were killed 3 h after anesthesia to perform histopathologic and immunohistochemical analyses hematoxylin-eosin staining caspase-3 activation. Eight mice per group were used for behavioral tests open field, T-maze spontaneous alternation, and water maze on subsequent days.   RESULTS There were no differences between groups in the T-maze spontaneous alternation test or in the open field no confounding effects of stress or locomotion. The group anesthetized with 1 isoflurane performed worse in the water maze task on day 1 550.4 162.78 cm compared with the control group 400.1  112.88 cm, 1.5 isoflurane 351.9  150.67 cm, and 2 isoflurane 364.5  113.70 cm P  0.05 and on day 3 305.0  81.75 cm compared with control group 175.13  77.00 cm and 2 isoflurane 204.11  85.75 cm P  0.038. In the pyramidal cell layer of the region cornu ammonis 1 of the hippocampus, 1 isoflurane showed a tendency to cause more neurodegeneration apoptosis 61.4  26.40, profiles/mm than the group with 2 of isoflurane 20.6  17.77, profiles/mm P = 0.051.   CONCLUSION Low isoflurane concentration 1 caused spatial learning impairment and more neurodegeneration compared with higher isoflurane concentrations. Results for mice receiving the latter concentrations were similar to those of control mice."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Overactivation of certain K channels can mediate excessive K efflux and intracellular K depletion, which are early ionic events in apoptotic cascade. The present investigation examined a possible role of the KCNQ2/3 channel or M-channel also named Kv7.2/7.3 channels in the pro-apoptotic process. Whole-cell recordings detected much larger M-currents 212  31 pA or 10.5  1.5 pA/pF in cultured hippocampal neurons than that in cultured cortical neurons 47  21 pA or 2.4  0.8 pA/pF. KCNQ2/3 channel openers N-ethylmaleimide NEM and flupirtine caused dose-dependent K efflux, intracellular K depletion, and cell death in hippocampal cultures, whereas little cell death was induced by NEM in cortical cultures. The NEM-induced cell death was antagonized by co-applied KCNQ channel inhibitor XE991 10 M, or by elevated extracellular K concentration. Supporting a mediating role of KCNQ2/3 channels in apoptosis, expression of KCNQ2 or KCNQ2/3 channels in Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells initiated caspase-3 activation. Consistently, application of NEM 20 M, 8 h in hippocampal cultures similarly caused caspase-3 activation assessed by immunocytochemical staining and western blotting. NEM increased the expression of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 ERK1/2, induced mitochondria membrane depolarization, cytochrome c release, formation of apoptosome complex, and apoptosis-inducing factor AIF translocation into nuclear. All these events were attenuated by blocking KCNQ2/3 channels. These findings provide novel evidence that KCNQ2/3 channels could be an important regulator in neuronal apoptosis."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"In this report, we examined the possible functions of the cell death protease, caspase-3, in the axotomy-induced apoptosis of facial motoneurons in newborn rodents. Using in situ hybridization and Western blot, we found higher levels of caspase-3 mRNA and pro-caspase-3 protein expression in motoneurons of neonatal and 2-week-old rats than adult rats. Following facial motoneuron axotomy, caspase-3 mRNA and protein expression increased in motoneurons of both neonatal and adult rats. However, using an antibody directed to the activated form of the caspase-3 protease, we found that catalytically active caspase-3 was present only in axotomized neonatal motoneurons. As motoneurons in neonatal but not adult rodents are susceptible to axotomy-induced apoptosis, we hypothesized that caspase-3 may play a role in their demise. To determine the necessity of caspase-3 activation in axotomy-induced apoptosis, we counted the number of surviving motoneurons at 4 and 7 days following axotomy in wild type mice and caspase-3 gene-deleted mice. There were nearly three times more surviving motoneurons in caspase-3 gene-deleted mice than in wild type mice at both 4 days mean 1074 vs. 464, Plt0.005 and 7 days mean 469 vs. 190, Plt0.005 following injury, indicating a slower rate of death. Examination of the dying motoneurons using TUNEL staining for fragmented DNA and bisbenzimide staining for nuclear morphology revealed incomplete nuclear condensation in caspase-3-deficient motoneurons. These results demonstrate that caspase-3 activation plays important roles in the rapid demise of axotomized neonatal motoneurons."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",PPARgamma activation,"Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors PPARs are nuclear transcription factors of the steroid receptor super-family. One member, PPARgamma, a critical transcription factor in adipogenesis, is expressed in ECV304 cells, and when activated participates in the induction of cell death by apoptosis. Here we describe a clone of ECV304 cells, ECV-ACO.Luc, which stably expresses a reporter gene for PPAR activation. ECV-ACO.Luc respond to the PPARgamma agonists, 15-deoxy-Delta12,14 PGJ2, and ciglitizone, by inducing luciferase expression. Furthermore, using ECV-ACO.Luc, we demonstrate that a newly described PPARgamma antagonist, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether BADGE has agonist activities. Similar to 15-deoxy-Delta12,14 PGJ2, BADGE induces PPARgamma activation, nuclear localization of the receptor, and induces cell death."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"Inflammation-induced microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 mPGES-1 is the terminal enzyme that synthesizes prostaglandin E2 PGE2 downstream of cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2. The efficacy of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and COX-2 inhibitors in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory pain, largely attributed to the inhibition of PGE2 synthesis, provides a rationale for exploring mPGES-1 inhibition as a potential novel therapy for these diseases. Toward this aim, we identified PF-9184 as a novel mPGES-1 inhibitor. PF-9184 potently inhibited recombinant human rh mPGES-1 IC50=16.5/-3.8nM, and had no effect against rhCOX-1 and rhCOX-2 gt6500-fold selectivity. In inflammation and clinically relevant biological systems, mPGES-1 expression, like COX-2 expression was induced in cell context- and time-dependent manner, consistent with the kinetics of PGE2 synthesis. In rationally designed cell systems ideal for determining direct effects of the inhibitors on mPGES-1 function, but not its expression, PF-9184 inhibited PGE2 synthesis IC50 in the range of 0.5-5 microM in serum-free cell and human whole blood cultures, respectively while sparing the synthesis of 6-keto-PGF1alpha PGF1alpha and PGF2alpha. In contrast, as expected, the selective COX-2 inhibitor, SC-236, inhibited PGE2, PGF1alpha and PGF2alpha synthesis. This profile of mPGES-1 inhibition, distinct from COX-2 inhibition in cells, validates mPGES-1 as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"An equimolal single dose 1 mmole/kg of leptophos or cyanofenphos was given orally to chickens to assay the clinical and biochemical neurotoxic effects of these two organophosphorus insecticides. Parathion and TOCP at 2 and 1000 mg/kg of chicken body weight were tested in the same manner as negative and positive neurotoxicants, respectively. Three birds of each of five groups tested were sacrificed 1,2,3,7,14,21 and 28 days after treatment and the brains were taken for the biochemical tests. Acetylcholinesterase AChE and neurotoxic esterase NTE activities were determined in the brain microsomal fractions. In addition, the AChE activity in the brain soluble fractions was measured. Clinical observations indicated that leptophos-, cyanofenphos- and parathion-treated chickens became acutely poisoned but recovered from the typical cholinergic signs in a day or two. However, about 10 to 15 days later leptophos- and cyanofenphos-treated chickens developed the characteristic leg weakness and unrecoverable ataxia seen in birds given TOCP. The biochemical results indicated that cyanofenphos followed by leptophos and parathion produced more in vivo AChE inhibition than that produced by TOCP in both chicken brain soluble and microsomal fractions. Results suggested that there are no correlations between the in vivo effect of TOCP, leptophos and cyanofenphos on AChE and phenyl valerate-total hydrolyzing activities and the ability of these chemicals to produce neuropathy in hens. The results obtained from this study of the in vivo effect of the tested compounds on chicken brain NTE activity present an acceptable correlation between the inhibition of this enzyme and the ability of these chemicals to induce neuropathy. The mechanism and explanation for this correlation are presented. The in vivo effect of the tested compounds on the chicken brain NTE activity was determined using the indirect and a new direct method. The data presented in this report suggested that the new direct technique of assaying NTE activity using 4-nitrophenyl valerate 4-NPV as substrate, can be useful in the in vivo screening studies of organophosphates for their ability to induce neuropathy in hens."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"The incompatibility of most organic solvents with acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition assay normally limits pesticide extraction efficiency in sample pretreatment, which might cause false negatives in real world sample assessment. Herein, a novel method has been developed for an improved AChE inhibition assay via organic solvent extraction combined spontaneous in situ solvent evaporation on microfluidic paper-based analytical devices. Enzyme pre-immobilization procedure was spared and AChE was added to the system after sampling step until a complete in-situ solvent evaporation process was performed on chip. IC50 levels of the six investigated organophosphate and carbamate pesticides indicated a completely eliminated influence of solvents on AChE behavior with the new method. Most importantly, analytical performances were significantly improved in food sample measurements. Reduction in matrix effect was observed when acetonitrile was adopted for lettuce sample pretreatment instead of water. Studies on different pesticides suggested a remarkably decreased discrimination effect on recoveries from sample pretreatment with the new developed method. The recovery level for phoxim spiked head lettuce samples reached 107.5  14.2 , in comparison with that of 18.6  1.4  from water-based extraction. Spiked water and apple juice samples with carbaryl concentration of as low as 0.02 mg L-1 were also successfully recognized with the present method by visual detection. This is the first report on direct sampling of organic extracts for AChE inhibition assay on-chip and it might provide a new perspective for real world sample assessments involving bio-reagents."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Culex tritaeniorhynchus Giles and Cx. gelidus Theobald Diptera Culicidae, both vectors of Japanese encephalitis, were collected in 1984 and 1998 from two disease endemic localities in Sri Lanka Anaradhapura and Kandy. Using wild-caught adult mosquitoes from light traps, log dosage-probit mortality curves for insecticide bioassays were obtained for three insecticides malathion organophosphate, propoxur carbamate and permethrin pyrethroid. LD50 values showed that, in 1998, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus was -100-fold more resistant to malathion and 10-fold more resistant to propoxur than was Cx. gelidus. This difference was attributed to Cx. tritaeniorhynchus breeding mostly in irrigated rice paddy fields, where it would have been exposed to pesticide selection pressure, whereas Cx. gelidus breeds in other types of aquatic habitats less prone to pesticide applications. Resistance in Cx. tritaeniorhynchus increased between 1984 and 1998, whereas Cx. gelidus remained predominantly susceptible. Propoxur inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE activity the target site of organophosphates and carbamates indicated that in 1998, frequencies of insensitive AChE-based resistance were 9 in Cx. gelidus and 2-23 in Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, whereas in 1984 this resistance mechanism was detected only in 2 of the latter species from Anaradhapura. The AChE inhibition coefficient ki with propoxur was 1.86/-0.24 x 105 M-1 min-1 for Cx. tritaeniorhynchus from Anaradhapura in 1998. Both species were tested for activity levels of detoxifying glutathione S-transferases GSTs and malathion-specific as well as general carboxylesterases. High activities of GSTs and carboxylesterases were detected in Cx. tritaeniorhynchus but not Cx. gelidus. Malathion-specific carboxylesterase was absent from both species. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis resolved two elevated general carboxylesterases, CtrEstbeta1 and CtrEstalpha1, from Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and none from Cx. gelidus. CtrEstbeta1 was the most intensely staining band. Gel inhibition experiments showed that both elevated esterases were inhibited by organophosphates and carbamates but not by pyrethroids. The major elevated esterase CtrEstbeta1 was partially purified 15-fold by sequential Q-Sepharose and phenyl Sepharose column chromatography. The bimolecular rate constant ka and the deacylation rate constant k3 for the malaoxon/enzyme interaction were 9.9/-1.1 x 103 M-1 min-1 and 3.5/-0.05 x 10-4 M-1 min-1, respectively, demonstrating that the role of this enzyme in organophosphorus insecticide resistance is sequestration."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Apoptosis may contribute to the development of heart failure, but the role of apoptotic signaling initiated by the endoplasmic reticulum in this condition has not been well clarified.   METHODS AND RESULTS In myocardial samples from patients with heart failure, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed an increase in messenger RNA for C/EBP homologous protein CHOP, a transcriptional factor that mediates endoplasmic reticulum-initiated apoptotic cell death. We performed transverse aortic constriction or sham operation on wild-type WT and CHOP-deficient mice. The CHOP-deficient mice showed less cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction compared with WT mice at 4 weeks after transverse aortic constriction, although the contractility of isolated cardiomyocytes from CHOP-deficient mice was not significantly different from that in the WT mice. In the hearts of CHOP-deficient mice, phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha, which may reduce protein translation, was enhanced compared with WT mice. In the hearts of WT mice, CHOP-increased apoptotic cell death with activation of caspase-3 was observed at 4 weeks after transverse aortic constriction. In contrast, CHOP-deficient mice had less apoptotic cell death and lower caspase-3 activation at 4 weeks after transverse aortic constriction. Furthermore, the Bcl2/Bax ratio was decreased in WT mice, whereas this change was significantly blunted in CHOP-deficient mice. Real-time polymerase chain reaction microarray analysis revealed that CHOP could regulate several Bcl2 family members in failing hearts.   CONCLUSIONS We propose the novel concept that CHOP, which may modify protein translation and mediate endoplasmic reticulum-initiated apoptotic cell death, contributes to development of cardiac hypertrophy and failure induced by pressure overload."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",PPARgamma activation,"RATIONALE Nitro-oleic acid OA-NO2 is a bioactive, nitric-oxide derived fatty acid with physiologically relevant vasculoprotective properties in vivo. OA-NO2 exerts cell signaling actions as a result of its strong electrophilic nature and mediates pleiotropic cell responses in the vasculature.   OBJECTIVE The present study sought to investigate the protective role of OA-NO2 in angiotensin Ang II-induced hypertension.   METHODS AND RESULTS We show that systemic administration of OA-NO2 results in a sustained reduction of Ang II-induced hypertension in mice and exerts a significant blood pressure lowering effect on preexisting hypertension established by Ang II infusion. OA-NO2 significantly inhibits Ang II contractile response as compared to oleic acid OA in mesenteric vessels. The improved vasoconstriction is specific for the Ang II type 1 receptor AT1R-mediated signaling because vascular contraction by other G-protein-coupled receptors is not altered in response to OA-NO2 treatment. From the mechanistic viewpoint, OA-NO2 lowers Ang II-induced hypertension independently of peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor PPARgamma activation. Rather, OA-NO2, but not OA, specifically binds to the AT1R, reduces heterotrimeric G-protein coupling, and inhibits IP3 inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and calcium mobilization, without inhibiting Ang II binding to the receptor.   CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate that OA-NO2 diminishes the pressor response to Ang II and inhibits AT1R-dependent vasoconstriction, revealing OA-NO2 as a novel antagonist of Ang II-induced hypertension."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND The precursor for advanced glycation end products, 3-deoxyglucosone 3DG is highly upregulated in skin explants of diabetic cutaneous wounds, and has been shown to negatively impact dermal fibroblasts, which are crucial in wound remodeling. 3DG induces apoptosis however the mechanisms involved in the apoptotic action of 3DG in the pathogenesis of diabetic chronic wounds are poorly understood. Therefore, we sought to delineate novel mechanisms involved with the 3DG-collagen induced apoptosis.   METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Using human dermal fibroblasts, we demonstrated that 3DG-modified collagen induces oxidative stress and caspase-3 activation. Oxidative stress was found to be dependent on the upregulation of NADPH oxidase 4 Nox4, a reactive oxygen species ROS Nox homologue, triggering endoplasmic reticulum ER stress, as assessed by the ER stress-induced apoptosis marker Growth Arrest and DNA Damage-inducible gene 153 GADD153. We demonstrated that 3DG-collagen activated GADD153 via phosphorylation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase MAPK, and this was dependent on upstream ROS. Inhibition of ROS and/or p38 MAPK abrogated 3DG-collagen induced caspase-3 activation. Our investigations also demonstrated that 3DG-collagen-induced caspase-3 activation did not signal through the canonical receptor for advanced glycation end products RAGE but through integrin alpha1beta1. To further verify the role of integrins, neutralization of integrins alpha1beta1 prevented 3DG-collagen-induced upregulation of ROS, GADD153, and caspase-3 activation suggesting that 3DG-collagen signaling to the fibroblast is dependent on integrins alpha1beta1.   CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Taken together, these findings demonstrate for the first time that a RAGE independent mechanism is involved in 3DG-collagen-induced apoptosis. Moreover, the ER stress pathway through activation of Nox4 by integrins alpha1beta1 plays a key role in 3DG-collagen-induced caspase-3 activation, which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic wounds."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"Prostanoids are a group of bioactive lipids that are synthesized de novo from membrane phospholipid-released arachidonic acid and have diverse functions in normal physiology and disease. NSAIDs non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which are among the most commonly used medications, ameliorate pain, fever, and inflammation by inhibiting COX cyclooxygenase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthetic cascade of prostanoids. The use of NSAIDs selective for COX-2 inhibition increases the risk of a thrombotic event eg, myocardial infarction and stroke. All NSAIDs are associated with an increased risk of heart failure. Substantial variation in clinical responses to aspirin exists and is associated with cardiovascular risk. Limited clinical studies suggest the involvement of prostanoids in vascular restenosis in patients who received angioplasty intervention. mPGES microsomal PG prostaglandin E synthase-1, an alternative target downstream of COX, has the potential to be therapeutically targeted for inflammatory disease, with diminished thrombotic risk relative to selective COX-2 inhibitors. mPGES-1-derived PGE2 critically regulates microcirculation via its receptor EP receptor for prostanoid E 4. This review summarizes the actions and associated mechanisms for modulating the biosynthesis of prostanoids in thrombosis, vascular remodeling, and ischemic heart disease as well as their therapeutic relevance."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs inhibit production of prostaglandins by acting on cyclooxygenase COX isoenzymes 1 and 2. Nonselective NSAIDs inhibit both COX 1 and 2 isoenzymes eg, ibuprofen and naproxen. Selective NSAIDs act on COX-1 eg, aspirin or COX-2 eg, celecoxib isoenzymes, respectively. Prostaglandins are produced in platelets and gastric mucosal cells through constitutively expressed COX-1 isoenzyme. They are involved in the regulation of hemostasis, functional integrity of the gastrointestinal and renal tracts, platelet function, and macrophage differentiation. Inhibition of COX-1 isoenzymes impedes platelet aggregation, impairs maintenance of protective gastric mucosal barrier, and affects renal function. Prostaglandin production in inflamed tissue results from de novo induction of COX-2 expression by inflammatory cytokines and other noxious stimuli. Thus, COX-2 isoenzyme inhibition either selectively or nonselectively helps in reducing inflammation in the setting of musculoskeletal disorders. Safety and efficacy of NSAIDs are related to their relative actions on COX-1 or COX-2 inhibition. Given the multisystem gastrointestinal, hematopoietic, and renal adverse effect profile of COX-1 inhibition, formulation of NSAIDs with relative COX-2 selectivity became a highly desirable target during the 90s. However, studies in the first half of this decade revealed adverse effects of COX-2 inhibition on the cardiovascular system, including increased risks of myocardial infarction, exacerbation of stable congestive heart failure, and worsening high blood pressure. Randomized trials and meta-analyses confirmed these findings, which led to withdrawal of some of the COX-2 inhibitors from the market by the federal Food and Drug Administration a few years ago. Here, we review the effects of COX-2 isoenzyme inhibitors on the cardiovascular system to provide a safe strategy for prescribing these agents in patients with existing cardiovascular disease. We did not find adequate long-term randomized controlled trials appropriately powered to evaluate cardiovascular outcomes. Potentially, all NSAIDs possess a fair risk of adverse effects on gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal systems. Until more evidence for safety via randomized trials is available, we recommend caution in prescribing COX-1 and 2 inhibitors for musculoskeletal disorders in patients with existing gastrointestinal or cardiovascular conditions."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"Zinc Zn-deficiency ZD is implicated in the pathogenesis of human oral-esophageal cancers. Previously, we showed that in ZD mice genetic deletion of cyclooxygenase-2 Cox-2 enhances N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine-induced forestomach carcinogenesis. By contrast, Cox-2 deletion offers protection in Zn-sufficient ZS mice. We hypothesize that ZD activates pathways insensitive to COX-2 inhibition, thereby promoting carcinogenesis. This hypothesis is tested in a Cox-2-/- mouse tongue cancer model that mimics pharmacologic blockade of COX-2 by firstly examining transcriptome profiles of forestomach mucosa from Cox-2-/- and wild-type mice on a ZD vs. ZS diet, and secondly investigating the roles of identified markers in mouse forestomach/tongue preneoplasia and carcinomas. In Cox-2-/- mice exposed to the tongue carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide, dietary ZD elicited tongue/esophagus/forestomach carcinomas that were prevented by ZS. The precancerous ZDCox-2-/- vs. ZSCox-2-/- forestomach had an inflammatory signature with upregulation of the proinflammation genes S100a8 and S100a9. Bioinformatics analysis revealed overrepresentation of inflammation processes comprising S100a8/a9 and an nuclear factor NF-B network with connectivity to S100A8. Immunohistochemistry revealed co-overexpression of S100A8, its heterodimeric partner S100A9, the receptor for advanced glycation end-products RAGE, NF-B p65, and cyclin D1, in ZDCox-2-/- forestomach/tongue preneoplasia and carcinomas, evidence for the activation of a RAGE-S100A8/A9 inflammatory pathway. Accumulation of p53 in these carcinomas indicated activation of additional inflammatory pathways. Zn-replenishment in ZDCox-2-/- mice reversed the inflammation and inhibited carcinogenesis. Thus, ZD activates alternative inflammation-associated cancer pathways that fuel tumor progression and bypass the antitumor effect of Cox-2 ablation. These findings have important clinical implications, as combination cancer therapy that includes Zn may improve efficacy."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",PPARgamma activation,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma PPARgamma is a transcription factor that regulates lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses. Certain PPARgamma ligands improve nonalcoholic steatohepatitis NASH. The role of PPARgamma itself in NASH remains poorly understood. The functional consequences of PPARgamma in the development of steatohepatitis through gene deficiency or gene overexpression of PPARgamma delivered by adenovirus Ad-PPARgamma were examined. Our results show that PPARgamma-deficient PPARgamma/- mice fed the methionine- and choline-deficient MCD diet developed more severe steatohepatitis than wild-type mice, and were unaffected by PPARgamma ligand rosiglitazone. Overexpression of PPARgamma delivered by Ad-PPARgamma attenuated steatohepatitis. This effect was associated with redistribution of fatty acid from liver to adipose tissue by enhancing expression of fatty acid uptake genes fatty acid binding protein-4 aP2, fatty acid translocase CD36, lipoprotein lipase LPL and fatty acid transport protein-1 FATP-1 and lipogenic genes sterol regulatory element binding protein isoform-1 SREBP-1 and stearoyl-CoA desaturase isoform-1 SCD-1 in adipose tissue and to a lesser extent in liver. The anti-steatohepatitis action of PPARgamma was also mediated via regulating adipokines through suppressing tumor necrosis factor-alpha TNF-alpha and interleukin-6 IL-6 and inducing adiponectin. Moreover, PPARgamma activation suppressed hepatic lipoperoxide and reduced hepatic pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6 production. In conclusion, PPARgamma is an important endogenous regulator and potential therapeutic target for nutritional steatohepatitis."

Adult male Wistar rats 200-250 g were trained in water maze for 4 days 3 days in hidden platform and the last day in visible platform task. Saline, LPS 250 microg/kg/ip or and agmatine 5 or 10 mg/kg were administered 4h before every training session.

"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Much evidence suggests that both oxidative stress and apoptosis play a key role in the pathogenesis of Parkinsons disease PD. The present study aims to evaluate the protective effect of bergamot juice BJ against 6-hydroxydopamine 6-OHDA- or H2O2-induced cell death. Treatment of differentiated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells with 6-OHDA or H2O2 resulted in cell death that was significantly reduced by the pre-treatment with BJ. The protective effects of BJ seem to correlate with the reduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide generation caused by 6-OHDA or H2O2. BJ also attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction, caspase-3 activation, imbalance of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, MAPKs activation and reduced NF-B nuclear translocation evoked by neurotoxic agents. Additionally, BJ exhibited excellent antioxidant capability in cell-free assays. Collectively, our results suggest that BJ exerts neuroprotective effect through the interplay with specific cell targets and its antioxidant activity, making it worthy of consideration for the management of neurodegenerative diseases."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"OBJECTIVES Akt is considered as an attractive target for anticancer drug discovery and development and therefore extensive efforts have been devoted to the discovery of new potent anticancer agents targeting Akt.   MATERIALS AND METHODS Due to the importance of thiadiazoles for anticancer drug discovery, herein eight 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives were investigated for their cytotoxic effects on C6 rat glioma and A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines using the MTT assay. The effects of the most promising anticancer agents on apoptosis, caspase-3 activation, mitochondrial membrane potential, and cell cycle arrest were determined on a BD FACSAria I flow cytometer. Akt activity was measured in the C6 and A549 cell lines using an ELISA colorimetric method. Schrdingers Maestro molecular modeling package was used to explore the possible binding modes of compounds 3 and 8 in the active site of Akt enzyme PDB code 3OW4.   RESULTS N-4-Chlorophenyl-2-5-4-nitrophenylamino-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylthioacetamide 3 and N-6-nitrobenzothiazol-2-yl-2-5-4- nitrophenylamino-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylthioacetamide 8 induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the C6 cell line through inhibition of Akt activity 92.36 and 86.52, respectively. The docking results of compounds 3 and 8 indicated that - interactions, H bonds, and salt-bridge formation were responsible for the observed Akt inhibitory activity.   CONCLUSION According to in vitro and docking studies, compounds 3 and 8 stand out as promising antiglioma agents."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Doxorubicin DOX is a broad spectrum anthracycline antibiotic used to treat a variety of cancers. Redox activation of DOX to form reactive oxygen species has been implicated in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. In this work we investigated DOX-induced apoptosis in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes isolated from adult rat heart. Exposure of bovine aortic endothelial cells or myocytes to submicromolar levels of DOX induced significant apoptosis as measured by DNA fragmentation and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated nick-end labeling assays. Pretreatment of cells with 100 microm nitrone spin traps, N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone PBN or alpha-4-pyridyl-1-oxide-N-tert-butylnitrone POBN dramatically inhibited DOX-induced apoptosis. Ebselen 20-50 microm, a glutathione peroxidase mimetic, also significantly inhibited apoptosis. DOX 0.5-1 microm inactivated mitochondrial complex I by a superoxide-dependent mechanism. PBN 100 microm, POBN 100 microm, and ebselen 50 microm restored complex I activity. These compounds also inhibited DOX-induced caspase-3 activation and cytochrome c release. PBN and ebselen also restored glutathione levels in DOX-treated cells. We conclude that nitrone spin traps and ebselen inhibit the DOX-induced apoptotic signaling mechanism and that this antiapoptotic mechanism may be linked in part to the inhibition in formation or scavenging of hydrogen peroxide. Therapeutic strategies to mitigate DOX cardiotoxicity should be reexamined in light of these emerging antiapoptotic mechanisms of antioxidants."

However, little is known about their mechanism of action. In this study, we investigate how BETT regulates prothymosin alpha ProT, a nuclear protein previously shown to play essential roles in apoptosis. We first showed that Apaf-1 is the direct target protein of BETT. We further demonstrated that BETT relieved ProT-mediated inhibition of apoptosome formation by blocking the interaction between Apaf-1 and ProT. Using two-dimensional 1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum correlation HSQC experiments, we were also able to examine the interaction between Apaf-1 and 15N-labeled ProT alpha. Furthermore, we were able to reconstitute the entire caspase-3 activation pathway using purified ProT, Apaf-1, procaspase-9, procaspase-3, Hsp70, cytochrome c, PHAPI, CAS, and regulatory compounds to mimic stress-induced apoptosis in vitro. Together, these studies would lead to novel and specific methods for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of human cancer."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"Alzheimers disease AD, a chronic degenerative and inflammatory brain disorder characterized by neuronal dysfunction and loss, is linked to accumulation of beta-amyloid Abeta peptide. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha TNF-alpha and cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 are proteins that have key roles in immune cell activation, inflammation and cognitive function in the brain. Here, we evaluated the link between TNF-alpha and COX-2 on the acute responses elicited by Abeta. Behavioral and molecular analyses were performed in mice after an intracerebroventricular i.c.v. injection of Abeta1-40. Genetic and/or pharmacological approaches were used to inhibit TNF-alpha and COX-2. I.c.v. Abeta1-40 injection in mice activates TNF-alpha signaling pathway resulting in COX-2 upregulation, synaptic loss and cognitive decline. Pharmacological studies revealed that COX-2 is involved in the cognitive impairment mediated by TNF-alpha. However, COX-2 inhibition failed in reducing the synaptophysin loss induced by Abeta1-40. The COX-2 upregulation induced by Abeta1-40 was attributed to activation of different protein kinases and transcriptional factors that are greatly regulated by TNF-alpha. Together, these results indicate that Abeta1-40 induces the activation of several TNF-alpha-dependent intracellular signaling pathways that play a key role in the control of COX-2 upregulation and activation, synaptic loss and cognitive decline in mice. Therefore, selective TNF-alpha inhibitors may be potentially interesting tools for AD drug development."

Moraceae by Sevag, anion-exchange chromatography and gel-filtration chromatography. On the basis of composition analysis, infrared spectra IR and nuclear magnetic resonance NMR experiments, FP2 is a linear pectin with a main chain composed of 4--D-GalpA-1. We investigated the anti-proliferative activity and its underlying mechanism of FP2 in HeLa cancer cells, using MTT assay and western blot analysis, respectively. Treatment with FP2 in HeLa cancer cells showed anti-proliferation effect and up-regulated the expression levels of caspase-3 and cleaved-PARP. IC50 values were 31.50 and 22.62 g/ml for 24 h and 48 h, respectively. FP2 has potential of antitumor possibly due to apoptosis induction mediated through caspase-3 activation and cleavage of PARP.

"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"To improve the survival and/or differentiation of grafted BMSCs bone marrow stem cells represents one of the challenges for the promising cell-based therapy. Considerable reports have implicated Sal B salvianolic acid B, a potent aqueous extract of Salvia miltiorrhiza, in enhancing the survival of cells under various conditions. In this study, we investigated the effect of Sal B on H2O2-induced apoptosis in rat BMSCs, focusing on the survival signalling pathways. Results indicated that the MEK MAPK mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK extracellular-signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 and 10 M Sal B remarkably prevented BMSCs from H2O2-induced apoptosis through attenuating caspase-3 activation, which is accompanied by the significant up-regulation of Bcl-2. In addition, the ROS reactive oxygen species accumulation was also reduced after Sal B treatment. Furthermore, Sal B inhibited the ERK1/2 phosphorylations stimulated by H2O2. Taken together, our results showed that H2O2-induced apoptosis in BMSCs via the ROS/MEK/ERK1/2 pathway and Sal B may exert its cytoprotection through mediating the pathway."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Two intracellular cysteine proteases calpains and caspases and inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS participate in the ischemic brain injury. In vitro nitric oxide NO regulates calpain and caspase-3 activation. The present study investigated whether aminoguanidine AG, an iNOS inhibitor, protected brain against experimental stroke through inhibiting calpain and caspase-3 activation. Rats received 1h ischemia by intraluminal filament, then, reperfused for 23 h R 23 h. AG 100 mg/kg was administered intraperitoneally 5 min before ischemia. Our data showed that treatment with AG markedly improved neurological deficit, reduced brain swelling, decreased infarct volume, and attenuated the necrotic cell death in ischemic penumbra and core, and apoptotic cell death in penumbra at R 23 h. Enzymatic studies demonstrated the significant inhibition of the activities of mu- and m-calpain and caspase-3, and Western blot analysis revealed marked increases in the levels of MAP-2 and spectrin in penumbra and core in AG-treated rats versus vehicle-treated rats. AG also significantly enhanced the calpastatin levels in core, although it had no significant effects on that in penumbra. These data demonstrate that inhibiting calpain and caspase-3 activation is one mechanism of AG against experimental stroke, suggesting that NO produced by iNOS may be involved in calpain- and caspase-3-mediated ischemic cell death, at least in part."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"To investigate the anticancer effects of the novel hydroxamic acid-derived histone deacetylase HDAC inhibitor MHY218, its efficacy was compared to that of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid SAHA in human ovarian cancer cells. The anticancer effects of MHY218 on cell viability, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis were investigated. In addition, MHY218 or SAHA was administered for 28 days in a tumor carcinomatosis model with SKOV-3 cells. MHY218 significantly reduced the expression of HDAC4 and HDAC7 in SKOV-3 cells. Similarly, MHY218 also inhibited total HDAC, HDAC1, HDAC4 and HDAC7 enzyme activity in a concentration-dependent manner. The anticancer effect of MHY218 IC50, 3.2 microM was more potent than SAHA IC50, 3.9 microM in suppressing the SKOV-3 cell viability. Moreover, MHY218 markedly increased expression of p21WAF1/CIP1, which acts as a cell cycle inhibitor. Cell cycle analysis showed that the high dose 5 microM of MHY218 significantly increased the proportion of cells in the G2/M phase. In particular, MHY218 and SAHA significantly increased the sub-G1 population and the number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells compared with those in the untreated control. These results were confirmed by analysis of poly-ADP ribose polymerase PARP, where MHY218 and SAHA increased the level of an 85-kDa fragment resulting from PARP cleavage as well as caspase-3 activity. Likewise, MHY218-induced apoptosis through caspase-3 activation was confirmed by the increase in the release of cytochrome c and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. In an in vivo tumor carcinomatosis model, the growth of transplanted SKOV-3 cells was inhibited by 71 after treatment with MHY218 10 mg/kg, whereas SAHA 25 mg/kg suppressed growth by 48. These results indicate that MHY218 is a potent HDAC inhibitor that targets regulating multiple aspects of cancer cell death and might have preclinical value in ovarian cancer chemotherapy, warranting further investigation."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"We investigated the effects of hyperosmolality on survival and proliferation of subconfluent cultures of mIMCD3 mouse renal collecting duct cells. High NaCl and/or urea but not glycerol reduces the number of viable cells, as measured with 3-4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide MTT. Raising osmolality from a normal level 300 mosmol/kg to 550-1,000 mosmol/kg by adding NaCl and/or urea greatly increases the proportion of cells in the G2M phase of the cell cycle within 8 h, as measured by flow cytometry. Up to 600 mosmol/kg the effect is only transient, and by 12 h at 550 mosmol/kg the effect reverses and most cells are in G1. Flow cytometry with 5-bromodeoxyuridine BrdU pulse-chase demonstrates that movement through the S phase of the cell cycle slows, depending on the concentrations of NaCl and/or urea, and that the duration of G2M increases greatly from 2.5 h at 300 mosmol/kg to more than 16 h at the higher osmolalities. Addition of NaCl and/or urea to total osmolality of 550 mosmol/kg or more also induces apoptosis, as demonstrated by characteristic electron microscopic morphological changes, appearance of a subdiploid peak in flow cytometry, and caspase-3 activation. The number of cells with subdiploid DNA and activated caspase-3 peaks at 8-12 h. Caspase-3 activation occurs in all phases of the cell cycle, but to a disproportionate degree in G0/G1 and S phases. We conclude that elevated NaCl and/or urea reduces the number of proliferating mIMCD3 cells by slowing the transit through the S phase, by cell cycle delay in the G2M and G1, and by inducing apoptotic cell death."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"In our study, some newly synthesized aryl-substituted pyrazole derivatives mimicking cis-diphenylethylene scaffold of two apoptotic inducing agents celecoxib and combretastatin A-4 were found to have strong antiproliferative as well as antiinflammatory activities. Among these coxib-combretastatin hybrids, two lead compounds 8 and 6c simultaneously inhibited prostaglandin E2 PGE2 production in LPS-activated murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells and suppressed cell cycle progression of MCF7 cells at G2/M or G0/G1 phases, but only compound 8 induced apoptosis via caspase-3 activation. Both the lead compounds showed good docking energies with both protein targets COX-2 and tubulin in the molecule interaction modeling. The cis-diphenylethylene scaffold of celecoxib or combretastatin A-4 as well as functional groups such as the ethyl ester group and the sulfonamide could be considered as potential key features for the dual activity of studied compounds meanwhile the trimethoxybenzene remained the crucial characterization of the newly derived compounds of combretastatins."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",EGFR signaling pathway,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS The liver is a highly regenerative organ, but its regenerative capacity is compromised in severe liver injury settings. In chronic liver diseases, the number of liver progenitor cells LPCs correlates proportionally to disease severity, implying that their inefficient differentiation into hepatocytes exacerbates the disease. Moreover, LPCs secrete proinflammatory cytokines thus, their prolonged presence worsens inflammation and induces fibrosis. Promoting LPC-to-hepatocyte differentiation in patients with advanced liver disease, for whom liver transplantation is currently the only therapeutic option, may be a feasible clinical approach because such promotion generates more functional hepatocytes and concomitantly reduces inflammation and fibrosis.   APPROACH AND RESULTS Here, using zebrafish models of LPC-mediated liver regeneration, we present a proof of principle of such therapeutics by demonstrating a role for the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR signaling pathway in differentiation of LPCs into hepatocytes. We found that suppression of EGFR signaling promoted LPC-to-hepatocyte differentiation through the mitogen-activated ERK kinase MEK-extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK-sex-determining region Y-box 9 SOX9 cascade. Pharmacological inhibition of EGFR or MEK/ERK promoted LPC-to-hepatocyte differentiation as well as genetic suppression of the EGFR-ERK-SOX9 axis. Moreover, Sox9b overexpression in LPCs blocked their differentiation into hepatocytes. In the zebrafish liver injury model, both hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells contributed to LPCs. EGFR inhibition promoted the differentiation of LPCs regardless of their origin. Notably, short-term treatment with EGFR inhibitors resulted in better liver recovery over the long term.   CONCLUSIONS The EGFR-ERK-SOX9 axis suppresses LPC-to-hepatocyte differentiation during LPC-mediated liver regeneration. We suggest EGFR inhibitors as a proregenerative therapeutic drug for patients with advanced liver disease."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"The present study examined the inhibitory effect of licorice compounds glycyrrhizin and a metabolite 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid on the neurotoxicity of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine MPTP in the mouse and on the 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium MPP-induced cell death in differentiated PC12 cells. MPTP treatment increased the activities of total superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase and the levels of malondialdehyde and carbonyls in the brain compared to control mouse brain. Co-administration of glycyrrhizin 16.8 mg/kg attenuated the MPTP effect on the enzyme activities and formation of tissue peroxidation products. In vitro assay, licorice compounds attenuated the MPP-induced cell death and caspase-3 activation in PC12 cells. Glycyrrhizin up to 100microM significantly attenuated the toxicity of MPP. Meanwhile, 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid showed a maximum inhibitory effect at 10microM beyond this concentration the inhibitory effect declined. Glycyrrhizin and 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid attenuated the hydrogen peroxide- or nitrogen species-induced cell death. Results from this study indicate that glycyrrhizin may attenuate brain tissue damage in mice treated with MPTP through inhibitory effect on oxidative tissue damage. Glycyrrhizin and 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid may reduce the MPP toxicity in PC12 cells by suppressing caspase-3 activation. The effect seems to be ascribed to the antioxidant effect."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"In this study, 15 novel compounds in a series of sulfonamide-based ketenes 7a-o were synthesized and characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. All compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit the human carbonic anhydrase hCA isoforms I and II, and acetylcholinesterase AChE. The halogen-appended compounds, 7g, 7o, and 7i, exhibited the highest hCA I/II and AChE inhibition, with the KI values in the low nanomolar range KI = 9.01  0.08, 7.41  0.03, and 7.37  0.31 nM, respectively, as compared with their corresponding parent 2-2,2-dicyano-1-phenylaminovinylthio-N-4-sulfamoylphenylacetamide analogs 7a-o. Besides, derivatives 7c and 7e selectively inhibited the isoform hCA I, whereas compounds 7m and 7n selectively inhibited isoform hCA II. These findings indicated that all compounds can inhibit metabolic dysfunctions, such as edema, epilepsy, glaucoma, and Alzheimers disease, by specifically targeting both the hCA isoforms and AChE expression. Herein, also the interactions between ligands and receptors were highlighted through in silico molecular docking studies. The molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area method was utilized to compute the binding free energy and the energy contribution of the critical residues in the active site was estimated. All these results would help us to perfectly understand the relationship between activity and structural characteristics of derivatives and to further improve newly and highly effective analogs targeting hCA and AChE."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"As an extension of an earlier investigation J. Med. Chem. 1984, 27, 1431, we prepared a series of 3-substituted 5-hydroxyiminomethyl-1,2,4-oxadiazoles and the corresponding 5-thiocarbohydroximic acid 2-N,N-dialkylaminoethyl S-esters. The compounds were evaluated in vitro as reactivators of phosphonylated electric eel and human erythrocyte RBC acetylcholinesterases AChE. The compounds were characterized with respect to hydroxyiminomethyl acid dissociation constant, nucleophilicity, octanol/buffer partition coefficient, reversible AChE inhibition, and kinetics of reactivating ethyl methylphosphonylated AChE. One compound was also tested for effectiveness in preventing AChE phosphonylation. All of the tested compounds significantly reactivate ethyl methylphosphonylated AChE the 3-n-octyl- and 3-1-naphthyl-substituted aldoximes are as reactive within a factor of 5-10 toward the inhibited enzymes as the benchmark pyridinium reactivators, 2-PAM and HI-6. All of the substituted thiocarbohydroximic acid S-esters are powerful reversible inhibitors of AChEs the 3-n-octyl- and 3-1-naphthyl-substituted thiocarbohydroximates inhibit eel AChE to 50 initial activity at concentrations less than 5 microM. When added to an eel AChE solution at concentrations between 5 and 50 microM, the 3-phenyl-substituted thiocarbohydroximate effectively antagonizes AChE inhibition by ethyl p-nitrophenyl methylphosphonate EPMP, suggesting the potential utility of this compound for preventing anti-AChE-agent poisoning."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"AIMS Irradiation-induced damage to pulmonary endothelial cells is thought to be an important mediator of the pathogenesis of radiation pneumonopathy. Tetrahydropalmatine THP has been shown to have a protective effect against oxidative stress. This study was designed to investigate the potential radioprotective effect of THP against irradiation-induced endothelial cellular damage and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.   MAIN METHODS Human EA.hy926 cells were treated with THP and irradiation. Cell viability was measured using a 3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide MTT assay. For the detection of apoptosis, morphological observation, flow cytometry and a caspase-3 activity assay were employed. The expression of cytochrome-c and Bax/Bcl-2 protein were detected by western blot analysis. Generation of reactive oxygen species ROS was measured by flow cytometry. Malondialdehyde MDA, lactate dehydrogenase LDH, glutathione GSH and superoxide dismutase SOD were measured to assess cellular oxidative stress induced injury.   KEY FINDINGS Preincubation of EA.hy926 cells with THP before gamma-radiation resulted in significant inhibition of apoptosis and enhancement of cell viability, as revealed by morphological observation, flow cytometry and MTT assay. THP significantly reduced intracellular ROS formation, levels of intracellular MDA and LDH, and enhanced the production of intracellular antioxidants GSH and SOD in EA.hy926 cells. Meanwhile, THP also inhibited the decrease of intracellular mitochondrial membrane potential psim, caspase-3 activation, cytochrome-c release and reduced Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in THP pretreated, irradiated cells.   SIGNIFICANCE Our findings demonstrated THP could effectively protect endothelial cells against gamma-irradiation injury, which could potentially be applied to the prevention of endothelial cell dysfunctions associated with ionizing irradiation-induced lung injury."

Single-walled carbon nanotubes are emerging as technologically important in different industries. However, adverse effects on cells have been reported and this may limit their use. We previously found that 200g/mL of single-walled carbon nanotubes induce apoptosis in rat aorta endothelial cells. The current study aimed to determine the signaling pathway involved in this process. We found that reactive oxygen species generation was involved in activation of the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway. The finding of apoptosis was supported by a number of morphological and biochemical hallmarks, including chromatin condensation, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3 activation. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that single-walled carbon nanotubes induce apoptosis in rat aorta endothelial cells and that reactive oxygen species are involved in the mitochondrial pathway."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Massive neuronal apoptosis and accumulation of protein aggregates in the cortex and hippocampus of the brain are hallmarks of several neurodegenerative disorders, indicating ubiquitin proteasome system UPS dysfunction. Lactacystin, a classical proteasome inhibitor, is used to simulate ubiquitin proteasome system dysfunction in neurons to mimic pathological features of neurodegenerative disorders. Based on Western blot analyses, we reported for the first time that annexin A3 AnxA3 is not only endogenously expressed in mouse cortical neurons but also more importantly, by gene expression microarray and real-time RT-PCR that it is greatly transcriptional up-regulated to approximately 11- and 15-fold, respectively in murine primary cortical neurons with 1M lactacystin for 24h. Up-regulation of AnxA3 expression occurred after 12-15h post-lactacystin treatment, which corresponded with the onset of neuronal injury, with approximately 25 of the neurons being non-viable by that time interval. Western blot analysis with anti-AnxA3 antibodies further validated that up-regulation of AnxA3 only occurs with onset of neuronal death, and not with the onset of proteasome inhibition, which occurs at 4.5h post-lactacystin treatment. Over-expression studies suggested AnxA3 might be involved in death promotion during lactacystin-mediated neuronal death, since caspase-3 activation was significantly stronger upon neuronal AnxA3 over-expression. We propose AnxA3 up-regulation may have significant relevance in the elucidation of neurodegenerative pathophysiology."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Disulfiram DSF is an FDA approved anti-alcoholism drug in use for more than 60 years. Recently, antitumor activity of the DSF/copper DSF/Cu complex has been identified. Its anti-multiple myeloma activity, however, has barely been investigated. In the present study, our results demonstrated that the DSF/Cu complex induced apoptosis of MM cells and MM primary cells. The results indicated that DSF/Cu significantly induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in MM.1S and RPMI8226 cells. Moreover, JC-1 and Western blot results showed that DSF/Cu disrupted mitochondrial membrane integrity and cleaved caspase-8 in MM cells, respectively, suggesting that it induced activation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways. Interestingly, DSF/Cu induced caspase-3 activation was partly blocked by Z-VAD-FMK zVAD, a pan-caspase inhibitor, indicating at caspase-dependent and -independent paths involved in DSF/Cu induced myeloma cell apoptosis machinery. Additionally, activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK signaling pathway was observed in DSF/Cu treated MM cells. More importantly, our results demonstrated that DSF/Cu significantly reduced tumor volumes and prolonged overall survival of MM bearing mice when compared with the controls. Taken together, our novel findings showed that DSF/Cu has potent anti-myeloma activity in vitro and in vivo highlighting valuable clinical potential of DSF/Cu in MM treatment."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"In this study, we show the crucial roles of lipid signaling in long-term depression LTD, that is, synaptic plasticity prevailing in cerebellar Purkinje cells. In mouse brain slices, we found that cPLA2alpha knockout blocked LTD induction, which was rescued by replenishing arachidonic acid AA or prostaglandin PG D2 or E2. Moreover, cyclooxygenase COX-2 inhibitors block LTD, which is rescued by supplementing PGD2/E2. The blockade or rescue occurs when these reagents are applied within a time window of 5-15 min following the onset of LTD-inducing stimulation. Furthermore, PGD2/E2 facilitates the chemical induction of LTD by a PKC activator but is unable to rescue the LTD blocked by a PKC inhibitor. We conclude that PGD2/E2 mediates LTD jointly with PKC, and suggest possible pathways for their interaction. Finally, we demonstrate in awake mice that cPLA2alpha deficiency or COX-2 inhibition attenuates short-term adaptation of optokinetic eye movements, supporting the view that LTD underlies motor learning."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",EGFR signaling pathway,"INTRODUCTION Epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the development and progression of lung cancer. We searched for mutations of EGFR pathway genes in non-small cell lung cancers NSCLCs and analyzed their relationship with clinicopathologic features.   METHODS Mutations of EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3, ERBB4, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PTEN, PIK3CA, LKB1, and AKT1 genes were determined by direct sequencing in 173 surgically resected NSCLCs--56 squamous cell carcinomas SCCs and 117 adenocarcinomas ACs.   RESULTS Of the 173 NSCLCs, a total of 65 mutations were detected in 63 36.4 tumors--10 17.9 in SCCs and 53 45.3 in ACs. Mutations in EGFR pathway genes were significantly more frequent in women and ACs than in women and SCCs p = 0.02 and p lt 0.001, respectively. The mutations occurred in a mutually exclusive pattern. When the genes were divided into three subgroups according to their roles in the signaling cascade, mutations in the EGFR/ERBB2 and KRAS/BRAF genes were more frequent in ACs than in SCCs p lt 0.001 and p = 0.01, respectively. In marked contrast, mutations in the PIK3CA/PTEN were more frequent in SCCs than in ACs p = 0.002. Furthermore, mutations in the PIK3CA/PTEN genes were more frequent in smokers p = 0.04.   DISCUSSION Our study demonstrates that mutations in each part of the EGFR pathway were associated with different clinicopathologic features in patients with NSCLCs."

Dietary d--tocotrienol suppresses the growth of implanted B16 melanomas without toxicity to host mice.   MATERIALS AND METHODS The proliferation of human A2058 and A375 melanoma cells following a 72 h incubation in 96-well plates was measured by CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution. Cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry. Fluorescence microscopy following acridine orange and ethidium bromide dual staining and procaspase-3 cleavage were used to detect apoptosis. Western-blot was employed to measure protein expression.   RESULTS d--Tocotrienol induced dose-dependent suppression of cell proliferation with 50 inhibitory concentrations IC50 of 37.5  1.4 A2058 and 22.3  1.8 A375 mol/l, respectively data are reported as mean  standard deviation. d--Tocotrienol-mediated cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase was accompanied by reduced expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 4. Concomitantly, d--tocotrienol induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. The impact of d--tocotrienol on A2058 cell proliferation was potentiated by lovastatin IC50=3.1  0.5 mol/l, a competitive inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase.   CONCLUSION d--Tocotrienol may have potential application in melanoma chemoprevention and/or therapy."

In this study, we evaluated the effects of RAL on epithelial PC growth using the two following in vitro models the androgen-dependent cell line EPN which expressed both ERs and a stabilized epithelial cell line derived from a prostate cancer specimen CPEC, which expressed low levels of ER and lacked ER. In EPN cells, there was an increase in the pre-G1 apoptotic peak and a reduction in the S phase of the cell cycle with G0/G1 arrest after E2 or RAL treatment bcl-2 mRNA and Bcl-2 protein levels were significantly reduced, while activated caspase-3 and Par-4 levels increased significantly after either E2 or RAL treatment in addition, c-myc transcript was inhibited after 10-6 M RAL treatment. A dose-dependent increase of metallothionein II gene RNA level was also induced by RAL in EPN. In CPEC, there was only a weak apoptotic peak associated with caspase-3 activation and Par-4 increase after either E2 or RAL treatment while c-myc transcript level increased. RAL induced a rapid but transient phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 in EPN cells but generated a sustained effect in CPEC. These findings suggest that RAL effects on PC growth control in vitro are cell-specific, depending on ER or ER/ER relative expression levels. Moreover, this study demonstrated that RAL affected both transcriptional regulation and non-genomic signals, which resulted in the modulation of multiple signaling pathways of apoptosis and of cell cycle progression."

"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"Adenocarcinoma in Barretts esophagus has been increasing in incidence at a rapid rate for more than two decades. Cyclooxygenase COX-2 appears to play an important role in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis, and COX-2 overexpression has been demonstrated both in esophageal adenocarcinomas and in the metaplastic epithelium of Barretts esophagus. The aim of our study was to determine whether selective inhibition of COX-2 by NS-398 would alter the rates of cell growth and apoptosis in human Barretts-associated esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines. COX-1 and COX-2 expression in adenocarcinoma cell lines was determined using reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting for mRNA and protein, respectively. Esophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines were treated with various concentrations of NS-398 selective for COX-2 inhibition and flurbiprofen selective for COX-1 inhibition. Cell growth was compared in flurbiprofen-treated and untreated tumor cell lines cell growth and apoptosis were compared in NS-398-treated and untreated tumor cell lines. COX-2 mRNA and protein were detected in two of three cell lines SEG-1 and FLO the third cell line, BIC-1, did not express COX-2 mRNA or protein under basal conditions or after stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Treatment with COX-1-selective concentrations of flurbiprofen did not affect cell growth in any of the three tumor cell lines. In contrast, treatment with COX-2-selective concentrations of NS-398 significantly suppressed cell growth and increased apoptosis in the cell lines that expressed COX-2 SEG-1 and FLO, but not in the cell line that did not express COX-2 BIC-1. We conclude that the administration of a selective inhibitor of COX-2 significantly decreases cell growth and increases apoptosis in Barretts-associated adenocarcinoma tumor cells that express COX-2. These observations suggest a potential role for selective COX-2 inhibitors in the prevention and treatment of esophageal adenocarcinoma for patients with Barretts esophagus."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"PURPOSE Recently, it has been demonstrated that ureteral obstruction is associated with increased cyclooxygenase COX-2 expression and that selective COX-2 inhibitors provide potent analgesia with fewer side effects in patients with ureteral stones. Moreover, selective COX-2 inhibitors have been shown to decrease in vitro contractility of the human ureter. We aimed at evaluating the effects of the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 on human ureteral smooth muscle contractility and compare its potency with that of nonselective COX inhibitors, COX-1 inhibitors, and other COX-2 inhibitors.   MATERIALS AND METHODS Ureteral samples were obtained from human adult subjects undergoing radical nephrectomy. After isolating the upper ureteral strips, we analyzed the contractile responses of the ureteral strips to high potassium KCl 35 mM and Bay K 8644 and the relaxation responses of a nonspecific COX inhibitor indomethacin, a COX-1 inhibitor SC-560, and a COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 and celecoxib to KCl and Bay K 8644-induced contraction by measuring isometric tension.   RESULTS NS-398 produced dose-dependent 10-9-10-5 M relaxation of KCl 35 mM-precontracted strips of the ureter, whereas indomethacin 10-8-10-5 M and SC-560 10-9-10-5 M did not. Both tonic and phasic contraction of Bay K 8644 methyl-1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3-nitro-4-2trifluoromethylphenylpyridine-5-carboxylate 1 M were significantly inhibited by NS-398 10-5 M. Another selective COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, did not show potent inhibitory effects as strong as those of NS-398.   CONCLUSIONS We concluded that NS-398 reduces tonic or phasic contraction by inhibiting the action of voltage-dependent calcium channels. NS-398 has dual inhibitory effects with COX-2 inhibition on ureteral spasms due to renal or ureteral colic."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",Cyclooxygenase inhibition,"The systemic circulation to the lung is thought to be an important microvascular exchange region which may contribute to pulmonary edema resulting from airway injury. In a chronic sheep model, we have evaluated the flow through the bronchial artery after airway injury caused by the aspiration of 2.5 ml/kg of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid with and without inhibition of thromboxane synthetase and cyclooxygenase. Cyclooxygenase inhibition with ibuprofen resulted in no rise in bronchial artery blood flow associated with airway acid aspiration 9.8 /- 1.72 ml/min to 63.7 /- 8.9 ml/min in the control group versus 11.3 /- 2.5 ml/min to 10.3 /- 3.4 ml/min in the ibuprofen group. No difference in bronchial artery blood flow was noted between control acid aspiration and acid aspiration with thromboxane synthetase inhibition. Significant early reduction in lung lymph flow was noted in the cyclooxygenase inhibition group compared to control. These data suggest that inhibition of the cyclooxygenase pathway of eicosanoid production may lessen the injury caused by airway acid aspiration. The decrease in airway blood flow with associated reduction in lymph flow suggests that airway blood flow may be important in the generation of pulmonary edema in this model."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",Cyclooxygenase inhibition,"The effect of cyclooxygenase inhibition in phorbol myristate acetate PMA-induced acute lung injury was studied in isolated constant-flow blood-perfused rabbit lungs. PMA caused a 51 increase in pulmonary arterial pressure localized in the arterial and middle segments as measured by vascular occlusion pressures, a 71 increase in microvascular permeability measured by the microvascular fluid filtration coefficient, Kf, and a nearly threefold increase in perfusate thromboxane Tx B2 levels. Cyclooxygenase inhibition with three chemically dissimilar inhibitors, indomethacin 10-7 and 10-6 M, meclofenamate 10-6 M, and ibuprofen 10-5 M, prevented the Kf increase without affecting the pulmonary arterial pressure increase or resistance distribution changes after PMA administration. The specific role of TxA2 was investigated by pretreatment with OKY-046, a specific Tx synthase inhibitor, or infusion of SQ 29548, a TxA2 receptor antagonist both compounds failed to protect against either the PMA-induced permeability or the vascular resistance increase. These results indicate that cyclooxygenase-mediated products of arachidonic acid other than TxA2 mediate the PMA-induced permeability increase but not the hypertension."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",estrogen receptor activity,"Autoradiographic evidence presented that the cultured rat ovarian surface epithelium exhibits estrogen receptor-like activity. Two autoradiographic techniques were used one involved live cells that were labeled and freeze-dried, and the other the labeling of ethanol-fixed cells. Autoradiograms were prepared by dipping cells grown on plastic cover slips in liquid nuclear track emulsion. Exposure times were 1 to 4 weeks. Experiments using a pulse-chase technique in live cells and steroid competition tests in fixed and live cells gave evidence for translocation of tritiated estradiol from cytoplasm to nucleus in live cells and for a component of estrogen-specific binding in live and fixed cells. The techniques presented here for the investigation of estrogen receptors in cultured cells require little tissue, are simple, and relatively quick. Reports based on biochemical analyses of tissue homogenates claim the presence of estrogen receptors in human ovarian carcinomas of surface epithelial origin and in rat ovarian surface epithelium. The results of this study add further evidence that the ovarian surface epithelium has estrogen receptor activity and should be considered an estrogen target tissue."

Survivin has been proposed as a cancer target, which highly expressed in most cancer cells but not normal adult cells. In this study, we investigated the regulation of survivin expression by exposure to oxaliplatin in human colon cancer cells. Oxaliplatin 3-9M for 24h markedly induced cytotoxicity, proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in the human RKO colon cancer cells. The survivin protein expression of RKO cells is dramatically reduced by oxaliplatin however, the survivin gene expression is slightly altered. The survivin blockage of oxaliplatin elevated caspase-3 activation and apoptosis in RKO cells. Over-expression of survivin proteins by transfection with a survivin-expressed vector resisted the oxaliplatin-induced cancer cell death. Meantime, oxaliplatin elicited the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase. SB202190, a specific p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, restored the survivin protein level and attenuated oxaliplatin-induced cancer cell death. In addition, oxaliplatin increased the levels of phospho-p53 Ser-15 and total p53 proteins. Inhibition of p53 expression by a specific p53 inhibitor pifithrin- reduced the phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase and active caspase-3 proteins in the oxaliplatin-exposed RKO cells. In contrast, SB202190 did not alter the oxaliplatin-induced p53 protein level. Furthermore, treatment with a specific proteasome inhibitor MG132 restored survivin protein level in the oxaliplatin-treated colon cancer cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that survivin is down-regulated by p38 MAP kinase and proteasome degradation pathway after treatment with oxaliplatin in the human colon cancer cells."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Taking advantage from the development of SV30, a new analogue of the pro-apoptotic molecule HA14-1, the aim of this study was to functionally evaluate SV30 and to develop safe nanocarriers for its administration. By using an inversion phase process, 57nm organic solvent-free lipid nanocapsules loaded with SV30 SV30-LNCs were formulated. Biological performance of SV30 and SV30-LNCs were evaluated on F98 cells that express Bax and Bcl-2, through survival assays, HPLC, flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and spectral imaging. We observed that SV30 alone or in combination with paclitaxel, etoposide or beam radiation could trigger cell death in a similar fashion to HA14-1. Although partially blocked by Z-VAD-fmk, this effect was coincident to caspase-3 activation. Hence, we established that SV30-LNCs improved SV30 biological activity together with a potentiation of the mitochondrial membrane potential decrease. Interestingly, flow cytometry and confocal analysis indicated that SV30 itself conferred to LNCs improved mitochondrial targeting skills that may present a great interest toward the development of mitochondria targeted nanomedicines."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"OBJECTIVE The chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12 are involved in the progression and dissemination of a diverse number of solid and hematological malignancies. Binding CXCL12 to CXCR4 activates a variety of intracellular signal transduction pathways that regulate cell chemotaxis, adhesion, survival, proliferation, and apoptosis.   MATERIALS AND METHODS Here, we demonstrate that the CXCR4 antagonist, 4F-benzoyl-TN14003 BKT140, but not AMD3100, exhibits a CXCR4-dependent preferential cytotoxicity toward malignant cells of hematopoietic origin. BKT140 significantly and preferentially stimulated multiple myeloma apoptotic cell death. BKT140 treatment induced morphological changes, phosphatidylserine externalization, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-3 activation, sub-G1 arrest, and DNA double-stranded breaks.   RESULTS In vivo, subcutaneous injections of BKT140 significantly reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, the growth of human acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma xenografts. Tumors from animals treated with BKT140 were smaller in size and weights, had larger necrotic areas and high apoptotic scores.   CONCLUSIONS Taken together, these results suggest a potential therapeutic use for BKT140 in multiple myeloma and leukemia patients."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Calmodulin CaM antagonists induce apoptosis in various tumor models and inhibit tumor cell invasion and metastasis, thus some of which have been extensively used as anti-cancer agents. In platelets, CaM has been found to bind directly to the cytoplasmic domains of several platelet receptors. Incubation of platelets with CaM antagonists impairs the receptors-related platelet functions. However, it is still unknown whether CaM antagonists induce platelet apoptosis. Here we show that CaM antagonists N-6-aminohexyl-5-chloro-1-naphthalene sulfonamide W7, tamoxifen TMX, and trifluoperazine TFP induce apoptotic events in human platelets, including depolarization of mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential, caspase-3 activation, and phosphatidylserine exposure. CaM antagonists did not incur platelet activation as detected by P-selectin surface expression and PAC-1 binding. However, ADP-, botrocetin-, and alpha-thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, platelet adhesion and spreading on von Willebrand factor surface were significantly reduced in platelets pre-treated with CaM antagonists. Furthermore, cytosolic Ca2 levels were obviously elevated by both W7 and TMX, and membrane-permeable Ca2 chelator BAPTA-AM significantly reduced apoptotic events in platelets induced by W7. Therefore, these findings indicate that CaM antagonists induce platelet apoptosis. The elevation of the cytosolic Ca2 levels may be involved in the regulation of CaM antagonists-induced platelet apoptosis."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"The widely expressed dipeptidyl peptidase-4 enzyme rapidly cleaves the gut hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 GLP-17-36amide at the N terminus to generate GLP-19-36amide. Both intact GLP-17-36amide and GLP-19-36amide exert cardioprotective actions in rodent hearts however, the mechanisms underlying the actions of GLP-19-36amide remain poorly understood. We used mass spectrometry of coronary effluents to demonstrate that isolated mouse hearts rapidly convert infused GLP-17-36amide to GLP-19-36amide. After ischemia-reperfusion I/R injury of isolated mouse hearts, administration of GLP-19-36amide or exendin-4 improved functional recovery and reduced infarct size. The direct actions of these peptides were studied in cultured neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. Both GLP-19-36amide and exendin-4 increased levels of cAMP and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase target protein kinase B/Akt. In I/R injury models in vitro, both peptides improved mouse cardiomyocyte viability and reduced lactate dehydrogenase release and caspase-3 activation. These effects were attenuated by inhibitors of ERK1/2 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Unexpectedly, the cardioprotective actions of GLP-19-36amide were blocked by exendin9-39 yet preserved in Glp1r-/- cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, GLP-19-36amide, but not exendin-4, improved the survival of human aortic endothelial cells undergoing I/R injury, actions sensitive to the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester L-NAME. In summary, our findings demonstrate separate actions for GLP-19-36amide vs. the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 and reveal the existence of a GLP-19-36amide-responsive, exendin9-39-sensitive, cardioprotective signaling pathway distinct from that associated with the classical GLP-1 receptor."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"The catechins, a family of polyphenols found in tea, can evoke various responses, including apoptosis. In this study we investigated whether the chemical modification of --epigallocatechin gallate EGCG could enhance its apoptosis activity. We found that one of the catechin conjugated with capric acid 2R,3S-3,4,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavan-3-yl decanoate catechin-C10 was most potent to induce apoptosis in U937 cells. C10 treatment resulted in a significant increase in reactive oxygen species ROS formation, mitochondrial membrane potential MMP loss, cytochrome c release caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation. In addition to this C10 also activated extrinsic pathway significantly as evident by time-dependent increase in Fas expression and caspase-8 activity. C10 mediated cleavage of Bid may be an important event for cross talk between intrinsic and extrinsic signaling. Moreover, pre-treatment of cells with anti-oxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine NAC significantly prevented C10-induced apoptosis but did not protect MMP loss. Treatment of cells with pan-caspase inhibitor significantly inhibited apoptosis indicating that caspases are playing key role. In addition to this C10 was found to induce apoptosis in human colon cancer HCT116 cells while it showed resistance to human keratinocytes HaCat. In short our results showed that the optimal fatty acid side chain length is required for the apoptosis inducing activity of catechin derivatives in U937 cells."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",PPARgamma activation,"In this and previous studies we investigated the importance of partial structures of Telmisartan on PPARgamma activation. The biphenyl-4-ylmethyl moiety at N1 and residues at C2 of the central benzimidazole were identified to be essential for receptor activation and potency of receptor binding. Now we focused our attention on positions 5 and 6 of the central benzimidazole and introduced bromine 3b-5/6, 3c, phenylcarbonyl 3d-5/6, hydroxyphenylmethyl 3g-5/6, hydroxymethyl 3h-5/6 and formyl 3i groups. The selection of these moieties was inspired by the structure of Losartan and its metabolite EXP3179. In order to increase the hydrophobicity of the central part of the molecule, the benzimidazole was exchanged by a naphtho2,3-dimidazole 5. The compounds 3a-3i and 5 were tested in a differentiation assay using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and a luciferase assay using COS-7 cells, transiently transfected with pGal4-hPPARgammaDEF, pGal5-TK-pGL3 and pRL-CMV, as established models for the assessment of cellular PPARgamma activation. An enhanced effect on PPARgamma activation could be observed if lipophilic moieties are introduced in these positions. 4-2-Propyl-1H-naphtho2,3-dimidazol-1-ylmethylbiphenyl-2-carboxylic acid 5 was identified as the most potent compound with an EC50 of 0.26muM and the profile of a full agonist. Together with compounds of the former structure-activity relationship study position 2-substituted benzimidazole derivatives 4a-4j, the binding mode of Telmisartan and its derivatives have been analyzed in 3D pharmacophore-driven docking experiments."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Excessive apoptotic cell death is implicated in a growing number of acute and chronic disease states. Caspases are critical for the intracellular signaling pathway leading to apoptosis. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the efficacy and the mechanism of action of the novel caspase inhibitor CV1013 in a well-characterized model of TNF-induced apoptosis. Administration of 700 mg/kg galactosamine/100 microg/kg endotoxin Gal/ET induced hepatocellular apoptosis in C3Heb/FeJ mice as indicated by increased caspase-3 activity 706 above controls and enhanced DNA fragmentation 3400 above controls at 6 h. In addition, apoptosis was aggravated by the neutrophil-induced injury at 7 h ALT activities 4220 /- 960 U/L and 48 /- 4 necrosis. All animals died 8-12 h after Gal/ET treatment from shock and liver failure. A dose of 10 or 1 mg/kg of CV1013 administered three times 3, 4.5, and 5.5 h after Gal/ET effectively prevented caspase-3 activation and parenchymal cell apoptosis at 6 h as well as the subsequent neutrophil-induced aggravation of the injury at 7 h after Gal/ET treatment. Animals treated with 10 mg/kg CV1013 survived for 24 h without liver injury. CV1013 reduced the processing of caspase-3 and caspase-8. This suggests that CV1013 may have inhibited the small amount of active caspase-8 generated at the receptor level. Because of the multiple amplification loops used to activate the entire caspase cascade, blocking the initial intracellular signal by CV1013 was highly effective in preventing apoptotic cell death. CV1013 has therapeutic potential for disease states with excessive apoptosis."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Based on accumulated evidence, we speculate that a high concentration of parathyroid hormone PTH may cause neurotoxicity in patients with uremia through apoptosis-induced neuropathy. In this study, we demonstrated that in vitro stimulation with PTH1-34 induced a significant decrease in PC12 cell numbers in both dosage- and time-dependent fashions when these cells were treated with PTH1-34 at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1 or 1.0 M for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, respectively, as assessed by the 3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide MTT method. Decreased numbers of PC12 cells were caused by PTH1-34-induced apoptotic and cytotoxic processes, as determined by DNA fragmentation, flow cytometry, and lactate dehydrogenase LDH-leakage assays. Upregulation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK and p38 signaling pathway was the underlying mechanism responsible for 1.0 M PTH1-34-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells, as elucidated by Western blotting analysis and confirmed with ERK and p38 inhibitors. Furthermore, 1.0 M PTH1-34-induced apoptosis was accompanied by a release of cytochrome c and subsequent caspase-3 activation. These data suggest that a high concentration of PTH1-34-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in PC12 cells was associated with upregulation of ERK and p38 through a mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Efforts to develop effective drugs targeting PI3K and KRAS signaling pathways in PIK3CA/KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer stem cells CRCSCs remain challenging. Finding safe compounds that can easily enter CRCSCs with the ability to target metastasis-driver gene CXCR4 and pluripotency network genes as key upstream and downstream effectors of both PI3K and KRAS signaling pathways may provide promising results. PIK3CA/KRAS-mutant CRCSCs display high expression of glucose transporters GLUTs on their cell membrane and a glycolytic phenotype providing an opportunity to deliver antiglycolytic compounds into these cells via the GLUTs. CRC patients with low levels of vitamin C in their plasma show a shorter survival suggesting the ability of this vitamin at the physiologic levels for caspase-3 activation and apoptosis in CRCSCs. Vitamin C in an oxidized form L-dehydroascorbic acid L-DHA with antiglycolytic activity can be taken up into CRC cells via the GLUTs. This may provide selective toxicity on CRCSCs and affect CXCR4 and stemness markers genes expression in these cells. To this end, we treated PIK3CA/KRAS-mutant LS174T cells with high glycolytic activity as an attractive model for CRCSCs with L-DHA equal to the pharmacological levels of vitamin C in human plasma, after which cell numbers, metabolic activity, proliferation-rate, CXCR4 and pluripotency network genes expression, caspase-3 activity with apoptosis were evaluated. 48 h post-treatment with 100- to 1000 M L-DHA, cell numbers were decreased and measured to be 70-47 control. L-DHA with selective toxicity on LS174T cells diminished metabolic activity and cell proliferation-rate to 1.4-0.8 Control OD = 1.5 and 92-54.5 respectively with no toxicity on PBMCs. L-DHA decreased CXCR4, Bmi-1, Sox-2 and Oct-4 expression to 45, 85, 45 and 48 control respectively followed by caspase-3 reactivation by 2.5 to 4.9-fold increases and induction of apoptosis ranging from 0.5 to 58.3 for 100- to 1000 M L-DHA. According to our data, CRC stem-like cells were highly sensitive to L-DHA in in-vitro. L-DHA selectively targeted LS174T cells and successfully reactivated caspase-3 and apoptosis in these cells. CXCR4, stemness marker genes and metabolic activity appear to be promising targets of L-DHA. Our results may provide a new therapeutic approach to target selectively GLUT-overexpressing PIK3CA/KRAS-mutant CRCSCs using L-DHA with no toxicity on normal cells."

The benzenesulfonamides used were sulfacetamide 3a, 4a, sulfaguanidine 3b, 4b, sulfanilamide 3c, 4c, sulfadiazine 3d, 4d, sulfamerazine 3e, and sulfathiazole 4e. The compounds were evaluated against carbonic anhydrase CA and acetylcholinesterase AChE enzymes to obtain possible drug candidate/s. The lead compounds of the series were 3a and 4a against human CA hCA I, whereas 3d and 4a were leads against hCA II in terms of Ki values. Series 4 includes more effective CAs inhibitors than series 3 except 3d. Series 4 compounds having a nitro group except 4d were 3.3-4.8 times more selective inhibitors than their corresponding analogues 3a-d in series 3, in which hydrogen was located in place of the nitro group, by considering Ki values against hCA II. Compounds 3c and 4c, where the sulfanilamide moiety is available, were the leads in terms of AChE inhibition with the lowest Ki values. The use of secondary sulfonamides was a more effective modification on CA inhibition, whereas the primary sulfonamide was the effective substitution in terms of AChE inhibitory potency."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",topoisomerase II binding,"The therapy of advanced mycosis fungoides MF presents a therapeutic challenge, and the search for new therapeutic targets is ongoing. PolyADP-ribose polymerase 1 was shown to be upregulated in patients with advanced MF and could be druggable by a new class of chemotherapeutic agents, PARP-1 inhibitors, which are already in clinical trials for other malignancies however, the role of PARP-1 inhibitors in MF has never been established. We examined the efficacy of talazoparib in the murine model of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The cytotoxic effect of talazoparib on Moloney MuLV-induced T-cell lymphoma MBL2 cells was a result of G2/M cell cycle arrest via the upregulation of p53. The in vivo experiments confirmed the clinical impact of talazoparib on MF tumors. When talazoparib was combined with the histone deacetylase HDAC inhibitor, romidepsin, the cytotoxic effect was synergized via downregulation of the DNA-repair genes Fanconianemia complementation group A FANCA, Fanconi anemia complementation group D2 FANCD2, and DNA topoisomerase II binding protein 1TOPBP1and stimulation of apoptosis via Blimp-1 PRDM1/Bax axis. Romidepsin increased the expression of IRF8 and Bcl-6, leading to upregulation of Blimp1and Bax whereas talazoparib upregulated Blimp-1 and Bax via upregulation of interferon regulatory factor 4 IRF4, leading to cleavage of caspases 6 and 7. Thus, a combination of talazoparib with romidepsin demonstrated the synergistic antilymphoma effect and warranted further investigation in a clinical trial."

Here, we determine if acetaminophen is efficacious in decreasing age-related increases in cardiac reactive oxygen species ROS and apoptosis in aging Fischer 344 X Brown Norway rats. Compared to 6-month control animals, indices of oxidative superoxide anion O2- and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal 4-HNE and nitrosative protein nitrotyrosylation stress were markedly increased in 33-month-old rat hearts. 33-month animals that had been treated with acetaminophen 30 mg/kg/day p.o. for 6 months exhibited diminished age-related increases in cardiac ROS levels and TUNEL positive nuclei and these changes were accompanied by improvements in the Bax/Bcl2 ratio, diminished evidence of caspase-3 activation and increased phosphorylation of protein kinase B, ERK1/2, p70S6K and GSK-3beta. Taken together these results suggests that acetaminophen may attenuate the age-associated increases in the cardiomyocyte apoptosis, possibly via diminishing age associated elevation in ROS production."

In vitro COX-1/COX-2 structure-activity relationships were determined by varying the substituents on the C-3 propenone moiety. Among the 1,2,3-triaryl-2-propen-1-ones, Z-1-4-methylsulfonylphenyl-2,3-diphenylprop-2-en-1-one 3b showed the most potency and selectivity on COX-2 inhibition COX-2 IC50 = 0.07 microM selectivity index = 201. The Z-propenones were also found to be more potent and selective than their E-isomers for COX-2 inhibitory activity. The structure-activity data acquired indicate that the geometry of propenone and also the type of substituents on the C-3 propenone are important for COX-2 inhibitory activity."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Arsenic trioxide, As2O3, already used in human anti-cancer therapy, is also an efficient agent against the autoimmune and inflammatory diseases developed in MRL/lpr mice. Inflammatory bowel diseases IBDs, notably Crohns disease, which remain without efficient treatment, display autoimmune and inflammatory components. We, therefore, hypothesized that As2O3 may be active on IBDs. Using the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced murine model of colitis, we demonstrate that As2O3 used either in a preventive or a curative mode markedly reduced the induced colitis as assessed by macroscopic and microscopic scores, leading to prolonged mice survival. In addition, As2O3 was able to inhibit NF-B expression and DNA-binding in colon extracts leading to decreased cytokine gene expression i.e. tumor necrosis factor-, interleukinIL-1, IL-12, IL-17, IL-18, and IL-23. Interestingly, As2O3 also reduced keratinocyte-derived chemokine KC, inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS mRNA levels, and myeloperoxidase MPO protein expression suggesting an impairment of neutrophils. This was associated with a marked increase of procaspase-3 and induced caspase-3 activation. This caspase-3 co-localized with MPO in the remaining neutrophils suggesting that As2O3 might have eliminated inflamed cells probably by inducing their apoptosis. These results assessed the potent anti-inflammatory effect of As2O3, that targets both NF-B and caspase-3 pathways, and suggests a therapeutic potential for Crohns disease and other severe IBDs."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Tri-o-cresyl phosphate TOCP is a neurotoxic organophosphorus compound that induces a characteristic central-peripheral distal axonopathy and Wallerian-type degeneration, 6-14 days after exposure. This organophosphorus compound-induced delayed neurotoxicity OPIDN has been extensively studied in the chicken, the standard test model. Reports of neurotoxic agents causing adverse effects on the male reproductive system initiated the present study which was designed to examine the effects of TOCP on the rooster. Previous work from this laboratory has demonstrated 100 mg TOCP/kg/day to be an OPIDN-inducing dose with minimal mortality in roosters. This dose level was administered to adult leghorn roosters p.o., n = 10 for 18 consecutive days. By days 7-10 of the study, TOCP-treated birds exhibited limb paralysis characteristic of OPIDN. Analysis at termination revealed significant inhibition of neurotoxic esterase activity NTE in both brain and testis. There was also a slight decrease in brain acetylcholinesterase AChe activity. Sperm motility was shown to be greatly decreased. In addition, sections of formalin-fixed, methacrylate-embedded testes from TOCP-treated birds showed vacuolation of, and disorganization in the seminiferous epithelium. The marginal body weight decreases 17 in treated animals were not considered to contribute to the testicular toxicity induced by TOCP. Parathion O,O-diethyl-O-4-nitrophenyl phosphorothioate, 0.1 mg/kg/day, p.o., n = 3 was used as a positive control for AChE inhibition and a negative control for inducing OPIDN. Roosters treated continuously with parathion showed a decrease in brain AChE activity, but no changes in NTE, testicular histology, or limb function. These studies demonstrate the testicular toxicity of TOCP in roosters and suggest that this effect is not related to the chemicals anticholinergic action."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Acrylonitrile ACN is a chemical that is widely used in the production of plastics, acrylic fibers, synthetic rubbers and resins. It has been reported that ACN can cause oxidative stress, a condition which is well recognized as an apoptotic initiator however, information regarding ACN-induced apoptosis is limited. This present study investigated whether ACN induces apoptosis in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, and whether its apoptotic induction involves oxidative stress. The results showed that ACN caused activation of caspase-3, a key enzyme involved in apoptosis, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Detection of sub-G1 apoptotic cell death and apoptotic nuclear condensation revealed that ACN caused an increase in the number of apoptotic cells indicating ACN induces apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. ACN dose- and time-dependently increased the level of proapoptotic protein, Bax. Pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine NAC, an antioxidant, attenuated caspase-3 activation by ACN, as evidenced by a reduction in proteolysis of PARP, a known caspase-3 substrate, as well as in the number of sub-G1 apoptotic cells. Moreover, induction of Bax by ACN was abolished by NAC. Taken together, the results indicate that ACN induces apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells via a mechanism involving generation of oxidative stress-mediated Bax induction."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"The effects of an oxidative insult on cell survival and tau metabolism were investigated in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. In this treatment paradigm cells were exposed to the membrane permeant oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide tBHP for 40 min, returned to fresh media and cell survival/death was monitored during the post-treatment period. Cell viability decreased significantly by 6 hr after tBHP exposure, and by 24 hr lactate dehydrogenase LDH release was 40.1 /- 8.8 in tBHP treated cells compared to 8.1 /- 4.7 in control cells. This oxidative stress paradigm also resulted in significant activation of caspase-3 by 2 hr post-treatment and nuclear apoptotic morphology. Furthermore, tBHP treatment also resulted in delayed tau proteolysis that was first evident 2 hr post-treatment. Treatment of the cells with the general caspase inhibitor Boc-AspOMe-Fluoromethylketone BAF completely inhibited caspase-3 activation in response to tBHP, and delayed, but did not prevent cell death. BAF treatment also decreased tau proteolysis. In vitro, recombinant tau was readily proteolyzed by active recombinant caspase-3 into a stable breakdown product. Further tau in the cell lysates was cleaved by active recombinant caspase-3 at a rate, and to an extent similar to that observed for the well-established caspase-3 substrate polyADP-ribosepolymerase PARP. These results suggest that oxidative stress-induced cell death occurs through both caspase-dependent and-independent pathways, and that tau is likely an in situ substrate of caspase-3."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli ExPEC is one of the top pathogens responsible for bloodstream infection and severe, often fatal, sepsis. Although the virulence factors and host immune responses to ExPEC infection have been investigated, the responses to a particular ExPEC strain could be very different. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of Cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 up-regulation in influencing the host defenses against infection of ExPEC XM O2K1H7. Our results demonstrated that ExPEC XM O2K1H7 infection in mouse and RAW264.7 macrophages leads to COX-2 up-regulation, and COX-2 inhibition significantly enhances ExPEC infection. The up-regulation of COX-2 in macrophages was mediated by Toll-like receptor 4 TLR4 through the activation of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase/Mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK/MAPK pathways. Further studies showed that COX-2 inhibition significantly decreased autophagy in macrophages during ExPEC XM O2K1H7 infection. Autophagy inhibition significantly enhanced, while induction reduced ExPEC XM O2K1H7 survival in macrophages. In addition, COX-2 inhibition significantly increased macrophage cell death during ExPEC XM O2K1H7 infection and increased the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 IL-10. Our results indicate that COX-2 up-regulation benefits host defense against ExPEC XM O2K1H7 infection by increasing autophagy in macrophages and by reducing IL-10 expression and macrophage cell death during ExPEC infection."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Identification of novel target pathways in glioblastoma GBM remains critical due to poor prognosis, inefficient therapies and recurrence associated with these tumors. In this work, we evaluated the role of nuclear-factor-kappa-B NFB in the growth of GBM cells, and the potential of NFB inhibitors as antiglioma agents. NFB pathway was found overstimulated in GBM cell lines and in tumor specimens compared to normal astrocytes and healthy brain tissues, respectively. Treatment of a panel of established GBM cell lines U138MG, U87, U373 and C6 with pharmacological NFB inhibitors BAY117082, parthenolide, MG132, curcumin and arsenic trioxide and NFB-p65 siRNA markedly decreased the viability of GBMs as compared to inhibitors of other signaling pathways such as MAPKs ERK, JNK and p38, PKC, EGFR and PI3K/Akt. In addition, NFB inhibitors presented a low toxicity to normal astrocytes, indicating selectivity to cancerous cells. In GBMs, mitochondrial dysfunction membrane depolarization, bcl-xL downregulation and cytochrome c release and arrest in the G2/M phase were observed at the early steps of NFB inhibitors treatment. These events preceded sub-G1 detection, apoptotic body formation and caspase-3 activation. Also, NFB was found overstimulated in cisplatin-resistant C6 cells, and treatment of GBMs with NFB inhibitors overcame cisplatin resistance besides potentiating the effects of the chemotherapeutics, cisplatin and doxorubicin. These findings support NFB as a potential target to cell death induction in GBMs, and that the NFB inhibitors may be considered for in vivo testing on animal models and possibly on GBM therapy."

The targeted compounds 5a-q, were synthesized by stirring alkyl/aralkyl halides 4a-q and compound 3 in a polar aprotic solvent. 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, EI-MS and IR spectral techniques were employed to confirm the structures of all the synthesized compounds. The compounds were biologically evaluated for BSA binding studies followed by anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory and acetylcholinesterase AChE activities. The active sites responsible for the best AChE inhibition were identified through molecular docking studies. Compound 5e bearing 4-chlorobenzyl moiety found most active antibacterial and anti-inflammatory agent among the synthesized compounds.

METHODS Eligible patients had stage IIIB, IV, or recurrent NSCLC with progression on the oral EGFR TKIs gefitinib or erlotinib. Cetuximab was administered intravenously at 400 mg/m on day 1 and then 250 mg/m weekly until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was response rate.   RESULTS Eighteen patients were enrolled. Patients were heavily pretreated with chemotherapy and TKIs average number of treatments = 4.2. The response rate was 0/18 0, and 28 of patients had confirmed stable disease. Median progression-free survival was 1.8 months 95 confidence interval, 1.6-5.4 months, and median overall survival was 7.5 months 95 confidence interval, 2.2-19 months. Three patients harbored activating EGFR mutations, and one of them had stable disease for nearly 6 months on cetuximab. Common toxicities were mild and included fatigue, skin rash, and nausea/vomiting. Two patients developed interstitial lung disease, life threatening in one case.   CONCLUSIONS Cetuximab monotherapy administered after prior EGFR TKI treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC does not yield clinical responses."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"The nerve agent soman, as well as other organophosphates such as paraoxon and phospholine in concentrations that caused cholinergic symptoms induced a progressive dose-related necrosis in rat skeletal muscle fibers. The severity of the myopathy depended on a critical decrease in activity and duration of acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition. The number of muscle fibers affected was greatest with soman, followed by tertiary phospholine, paraxon , and quaternary phospholine. The necrotic nerve fibers were repaired within 1 week. Atropine and gentamycin in concentrations that do not block neuromuscular transmission, attenuate the necrotic action of the organophosphates by interacting with the presynaptic Ca2 uptake mechanism. The half-time recovery rate of AChE after exposure to soman varied between 12 hr for sciatic nerve, 5-9 days for muscle, and 14 days for brain. AChE activity of peripheral nerve was minimally inhibited by soman and had recovered to control activity within 24 hr. The reason for this apparent insensitivity of the nerve AChE to soman may be due to the high activity of an enzyme that hydrolyzes soman. AChE at the neuromuscular junction in part has a protective and regulatory function through its control of free acetylcholine ACh. By limiting the accumulation of ACh and the extent of its interaction with pre- and postsynaptic membranes, the morphological integrity of nerve terminals and muscle is preserved."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"To evaluate whether overexpression of Bax, an apoptosis-promoting gene, sensitizes KATOIII gastric cancer cells to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents, three stable cell lines of KATOIII transfected with Bax KATOIII-Bax, Bcl-2 KATOIII-Bcl-2, or control pCI-neo expression vector KATOIII-pCI-neo were established. The cells were treated with paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil, or doxorubicin, and the apoptotic response was measured. Our results showed that the sensitivity of the KATOIII-Bax cells to chemotherapeutic agents was enhanced compared with that of the KATOIII-pCI-neo cells, and the KATOIII-Bcl-2 cells were more resistant to these agents. Western blotting revealed that cytochrome c level in the cytosol fraction of the KATOIII-Bax cells was higher than that of the KATOIII-pCI-neo cells. Significant increase of cytochrome c level in the cytosol fraction of the KATOIII-Bax cells was detected 24 h after exposure to chemotherapeutic agents, when apoptotic cells were less than 10. The cytochrome c level in the cytosol fraction of the KATOIII-Bax cells was higher than that of the KATOIII-pCI-neo cells at all time points examined after exposure to chemotherapeutic agents. Marked activation of caspase-3 in the KATOIII-Bax cells was observed 48 h and 72 h after exposure to chemotherapeutic agents compared with that in the KATOIII-pCI-neo cells. Consistently, zVAD-fmk, a pancaspase inhibitor, repressed the paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. In addition, Bcl-2 overexpression strongly blocked KATOIII cell apoptosis by inhibiting the cytochrome c release from mitochondria and caspase-3 activation. These findings suggest that cytochrome c release is a major mechanism of apoptotic response and Bax overexpression sensitizes KATOIII cells to chemotherapeutic agent-induced apoptosis through enhancing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",estrogen receptor activity,"Of 398 cases of breast cancer, 350 included data for all of the following patient age, tumor size, histologic type, presence or absence of lymph node metastasis, nuclear grade of the cancer cells, extent of lymphocytic infiltration around these cells, and estrogen receptor status of the neoplastic tissue. This series is representative of and comparable with those reported in other studies of breast carcinoma. Initial evaluation suggested a relationship of cytologic differentiation and lymphocytic infiltration to estrogen receptor activity. More extensive statistical analyses, however, demonstrated that three factor interrelationships best explain the data concerning nuclear grade, lymphocytic infiltration, and estrogen receptor activity of the tumors in this study. Thus, the results of this investigation serve to warn against inferential judgments based on limited data or restricted evaluation. In addition, the analyses call attention to a significant association between age and lymphocytic infiltration around the tumor cells."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"It is well known that tumor-surrounding stromal tissues support tumor development through secreting soluble factors such as various cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. It has also been suggested that tumor-associated fibroblast and immune cells have a high expression of cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 and produce and secrete several prostaglandins PGs to adjacent cancer tissues. From these findings, we assumed that COX-2 inhibition might have an anticancer effect on cancer cells even without COX-2 expression in COX-2-dependent mechanisms through blocking the effect of stroma-derived PGs. Here, because of the complex involvement of various factors in vivo, we investigated this possibility with an in vivo-mimicking model using a Transwell system. To test our hypothesis, we used COX-2-transfected cell lines as stromal cells in our model. When we cocultured cancer cells LS174T cells without COX-2 expression with COX-2-high stromal cells in the Transwell membrane system, we observed that the proliferation of cancer cells was promoted and vascular endothelial growth factor synthesis was up-regulated significantly. These effects were blocked completely by COX-2 inhibitors and phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibitors and partially by the PG E2 receptor 4 antagonist. Even if some cancer cells did not express COX-2, they were found to have expression of PG receptors and PG-related downstream signaling molecules associated with cell viability. Our observation suggests that these cells can be influenced by PGs derived from stromal tissues. These findings also suggest that COX-2 inhibitors can be used to control the interaction between cancer and surrounding stromal tissues and suppress the proliferation of cancer cells regardless of the expression of COX-2 in cancer cells."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Eryptosis is a physiological, apoptosis-like death of injured erythrocytes crucial to prevent premature haemolysis and the pathological sequalae generated by cell-free haemoglobin. When dysregulated, the process is associated to several inflammatory-based pathologies. 4-Hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal HNE is an endogenous signalling molecule at physiological levels and, at higher concentrations, is involved in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory-based diseases. This work evaluated whether HNE could induce eryptosis in human erythrocytes.   METHODS Measurements of phosphatidylserine, cell volume, intracellular oxidants, Ca, glutathione, ICAM-1, and ceramide were assessed by flow cytometry. Scanning electron microscopy evaluated morphological alterations of erythrocytes. Western blotting assessed caspases. PGE2 was measured by ELISA. Adhesion of erythrocytes on endothelial cells was evaluated by gravity adherence assay.   RESULTS HNE in the concentration range between 10-100 M induces eryptosis, morphological alterations correlated to caspase-3 activation, and increased Ca levels. The process is not mediated by redox-dependent mechanisms rather, it strongly depends on PGE2 and ceramide. Interestingly, HNE induces significant increase of erythrocytes adhesion to endothelial cells ECs that are in turn dysfunctionated as evident by overexpression of ICAM-1.   CONCLUSIONS Our results unveil a new physiopathological role for HNE, provide mechanistic details of the HNE-induced eryptosis, and suggest a novel mechanism through which HNE could exert pro-inflammatory effects."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Two series of 3-1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-ylmethylquinazolin-43H-ones and N-1-benzylpiperidin-4-ylquinazolin-4-amines were designed initially as potential acetylcholine esterase inhibitors. Biological evaluation demonstrated that N-1-benzylpiperidin-4-ylquinazolin-4-amines significantly inhibited AChE activity. Especially, two compounds of them were found to be the most potent with relative AChE inhibition percentages of 87  in comparison to donepezil. The docking studies with AChE showed similar interactions between donepezil and four derivatives. N-1-Benzylpiperidin-4-ylquinazolin-4-amines also exhibited significant DPPH scavenging effects. The two series of compound also exerted moderate to good cytotoxicity against three human cancer cell lines, including SW620 human colon cancer, PC-3 prostate cancer, and NCI-H23 lung cancer, with 3-1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-ylmethylquinazolin-43H-one being the most cytotoxic agent. 3-1-Benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-ylmethylquinazolin-43H-one significantly induced early apoptosis and arrested the SW620 cells at G2/M phase. From this study, two compounds of N-1-benzylpiperidin-4-ylquinazolin-4-amines could serve as new leads for further design and AChE inhibitors, while 3-1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-ylmethylquinazolin-43H-one could serve as a new lead for the design and development of more potent anticancer agents."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"This study was designed to investigate the effect of two surfactants, dodecyl benzyl sulfonate DBS, sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS, and of a domestic detergent Y on the AChE activity of the crustacean cladoceran Daphnia magna. All the chemicals significantly inhibit the activity of the enzyme, both in vitro and in vivo conditions. In vitro lowest observed effect concentration LOEC values ranged from 12.5 to 100 mg/l and correspondent IC50 50 inhibition concentration values ranged from 6.6 to 58.5 mg/l. In vivo LOEC values ranged from 2 to 11.9 mg/l, while EC50 50 effect concentration values ranged from 11.4 to 56.7 mg/l. AChE inhibition by environmental contaminants such as surfactants, detergents and metals may lead to false diagnostics and even wrong conclusions in biomonitoring studies based on the use of AChE as a specific biomarker for organophosphorous and carbamate compounds."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Aminoguanidine is an inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS and is of potential clinical usefulness. Treatment of mice with anti-Fas antibodies 150 microg/kg, i.v. induced elevation of plasma alanine aminotransferase activity at 4 h and this elevation was inhibited by pretreatment of mice with aminoguanidine 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg, i.p.. The anti-Fas antibody-induced elevation of caspase-3 activity was inhibited by aminoguanidine 30 mg/kg, i.p., but the addition of aminoguanidine to the cytosol up to 10-4 M did not inhibit the caspase-3 activity in vitro. Thus, aminoguanidine prevents anti-Fas antibody-induced hepatitis by affecting the apoptotic pathway upstream of caspase-3 activation."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Okadaic acid OA is a specific and potent protein phosphatase inhibitor and tumor promoter. The present study establishes the role of reactive oxygen species ROS and mitogen activated protein kinases in cell death induced by okadaic acid. The study showed that okadaic acid is cytotoxic at 10 nM with an IC50 of 100 nM in U-937 cells. The CVDE assay and mitochondrial dehydrogenase assay showed a time dependent cytotoxicity. The phase contrast visualization of the OA treated cells showed the apoptotic morphology and was confirmed with esterase staining for plasma membrane integrity. OA activated caspases-7, 9 and 3, PARP cleavage and induced nuclear damage in a time and dose dependent manner. Compromised mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome-c and apoptosis inducing factor confirms the involvement of mitochondria. A time dependent decrease in glutathione levels and a dose dependent increase in ROS with maximum at 30 min were observed. ROS scavenger-N-acetyl cysteine, mitochondrial stabilizer-cyclosporin-A, and broad spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK inhibited the OA induced caspase-3 activation, DNA damage and cell death but caspase-8 inhibitor had no effect. OA activated p38 MAPK and JNK in a time dependent manner, but not ERK. MAP kinase inhibitors SB203580, SP600125 and PD98059 confirm the role of p38 MAPK and JNK in OA induced caspase-3 activation and cell death. Over all, our results indicate that OA induces cell death by generation of ROS, and activation of p38 MAPK and JNK, and executed through mitochondrial mediated caspase pathway."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Traumatic brain injury TBI results in numerous central and systemic responses that complicate interpretation of the effects of the primary mechanical trauma. For this reason, several in vitro models of mechanical cell injury have recently been developed that allow more precise control over intra- and extracellular environments than is possible in vivo. Although we recently reported that calpain and caspase-3 proteases are activated after TBI in rats, the role of calpain and/or caspase-3 has not been examined in any in vitro model of mechanical cell injury. In this investigation, varying magnitudes of rapid mechanical cell stretch were used to examine processing of the cytoskeletal protein alpha-spectrin 280 kDa to a signature 145-kDa fragment by calpain and to the apoptotic-linked 120-kDa fragment by caspase-3 in septo-hippocampal cell cultures. Additionally, effects of stretch injury on cell viability and morphology were assayed. One hour after injury, maximal release of cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase and nuclear propidium iodide uptake were associated with peak accumulations of the calpain-specific 145-kDa fragment to alpha-spectrin at each injury level. The acute period of calpain activation 1-6 h was associated with subpopulations of nuclear morphological alterations that appeared necrotic hyperchromatism or apoptotic condensed, shrunken nuclei. In contrast, caspase-3 processing of alpha-spectrin to the apoptotic-linked 120-kDa fragment was only detected 24 h after moderate, but not mild or severe injury. The period of caspase-3 activation was predominantly associated with nuclear shrinkage, fragmentation, and apoptotic body formation characteristic of apoptosis. Results of this study indicate that rapid mechanical stretch injury to septo-hippocampal cell cultures replicates several important biochemical and morphological alterations commonly observed in vivo brain injury, although important differences were also noted."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Targeted therapies acting on specific molecular targets in cancer cells with better curative efficacy and lower toxicity have come into prominence for the management of nonsmall cell lung cancer NSCLC and colorectal cancer CRC. COX-2 stands out as a plausible target for anticancer agents due to its pivotal role in tumor initiation, progression and invasion.   OBJECTIVES Due to the importance of triazolothiadiazine scaffold in targeted anticancer drug discovery, the aim of this work is the design of new triazolothiadiazines as potential anticancer agents for the targeted therapy of NSCLC and CRC.   METHODS New triazolo3,4-b-1,3,4-thiadiazines 2a-g were synthesized via the ring closure reactions of 2-bromo-1-arylethanones with 4-amino-5-5-methoxy-2-methyl-1H-indol-3-ylmethyl-2,4- dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thione 1, which was obtained via the solvent-free reaction of 5- methoxy-2-methyl-3-indoleacetic acid with thiocarbohydrazide. MTT assay was performed to determine their cytotoxic effects on A549 human lung adenocarcinoma, Caco-2 human colorectal adenocarcinoma and CCD-19Lu human lung fibroblast cells. The most potent compounds were evaluated for their effects on apoptosis, caspase-3, mitochondrial membrane potential, cell cycle, ultrastructural morphological changes and COX-2 in A549 and Caco-2 cells. In silico docking and Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion ADME studies were also performed using Schrdingers Maestro molecular modeling package.   RESULTS 6-4-Chlorophenyl-3-5-methoxy-2-methyl-1H-indol-3-ylmethyl-7H-1,2,4triazolo3,4- b1,3,4thiadiazine 2e was the most potent and selective anticancer agent in this series against A549 and Caco-2 cell lines. Compound 2e induced early apoptosis, caused mitochondrial membrane depolarization and arrested cell cycle at G0/G1 phase in A549 cells. On the other hand, compound 2e triggered intrinsic apoptotic pathway involving caspase-3 activation in Caco-2 cells. Compound 2e caused apoptotic morphological changes in both cancer cell lines. The cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of this compound on CRC were found to be related to its selective COX-2 inhibitory activity. According to molecular docking studies, compound 2e showed good affinity to the active site of COX-2 PDB code 4COX. Based on in silico ADME studies, the compound is predicted to possess a favorable ADME profile.   CONCLUSION According to in vitro and in silico studies, compound 2e was identified as a potential orally bioavailable anticancer agent for COX-2-targeted therapy of CRC."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Fasciculin 2 FAS, an acetylcholinesterase AChE peripheral site ligand that inhibits mammalian AChE in the picomolar range and chicken AChE only at micromolar concentrations, was used in chick retinal cell cultures to evaluate the influence of AChE on neuronal development. The effects of other AChE inhibitors that bind the active and/or the peripheral site of the enzyme paraoxon, eserine, or 1,5-bis4-allyldimethylammoniumphenyl pentan-3-one dibromide BW284c51 were also studied. Morphological changes of cultured neurons were observed with the drugs used and in the different cell culture systems studied. Cell aggregates size decreased by more than 35 in diameter after 9 days of FAS treatment, mainly due to reduction in the presumptive plexiform area of the aggregates. Eserine showed no effect on the morphology of the aggregates, although it fully inhibited the activity of AChE. In dense stationary cell culture, cluster formation increased after 3 days and 6 days of FAS treatment. However, FAS, at concentrations in which changes of morphological parameters were observed, did not inhibit the AChE activity as measured histochemically. In contrast, paraoxon treatment produced a slight morphological alteration of the cultures, while a strong inhibition of enzyme activity caused by this agent was observed. BW284c51 showed a harmful, probably toxic effect, also causing a slight AChE inhibition. It is suggested that the effect of an anticholinesterase agent on the morphological modifications of cultured neurons is not necessarily associated with the intensity of the AChE inhibition, especially in the case of FAS. Moreover, most of the effects of AChE on culture morphology appear to be independent of the cholinolytic activity of the enzyme. The results obtained demonstrate that FAS is not toxic for the cells and suggest that regions of the AChE molecule related to the enzyme peripheral site are likely to be involved with the nonclassical role of AChE."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"A set of 5-phenyl-1-3-pyridyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxylic acid derivatives 1632 showing anti-inflammatory activity was analyzed using a three-dimensional qualitative structure-selectivity relationship 3D QSSR method. The CatalystHipHop approach was used to generate a pharmacophore model for cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 inhibitors based on a training set of 15 active inhibitors 115. The degree of fitting of the test set compounds 1632 to the generated hypothetical model revealed a qualitative measure of the more or less selective COX-2 inhibition of these compounds. The results indicate that most derivatives 16, 18, 2025, and 3032 are able to effectively satisfy the proposed pharmacophore geometry using energy accessible conformers Econf lt 20 kcal/mol. In addition, the triazole derivatives 1632 were docked into COX-1 and COX-2 X-ray structures, using the program GOLD. Based on the docking results it is suggested that several of these novel triazole derivatives are active COX inhibitors with a significant preference for COX-2. In principle, this work presents an interesting, comprehensive approach to theoretically predict the mode of action of compounds that showed anti-inflammatory activity in an in vivo model."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Of the following neurotoxic agents, pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate soman, isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate sarin and ethyl N,N-dimethylphosphoramidocyanidate tabun, only soman was inactivated appreciably at pH 7.40 by beta-cyclodextrin. The interaction of soman, a mixture of four stereoisomers designated as CP-, C-P-, CP, and C-P, with cyclodextrins was revealed by methods based on the irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE that is phosphonylated chiefly by P--isomers of racemic soman and continuous titration of fluoride ions released by soman using a fluoride-specific electrode. Soman and beta-cyclodextrin form a 11 complex. At pH 7.40 and 25 degrees C the dissociation constant Kd of this complex and the rate constant k2 of cleavage of soman by beta-cyclodextrin are 0.53 /- 0.05 mM and 5.9 /- 0.6 X 10-2 min-1, respectively. The rate constant k2 max for the cleavage of soman by monoionized beta-cyclodextrin has a value of 2.8 X 103 min-1 and the second order rate constant k2 max/kd is 5.3 X 106 M-1 min-1. Consequently, soman is hydrolyzed about 2500 times faster by the monoanion of beta-cyclodextrin, than by the hydroxide ion. The cleavage of P--soman by beta-cyclodextrin as estimated by AChE inhibition proceeds apparently at the same rate for the C-P--and CP--isomers. However, the release of fluoride ions indicated a stereospecific rate of reaction, the P--isomers reacting faster than the P-isomers. At pH 7.40, the inactivation rate of soman by beta-cyclodextrin was as fast in human plasma in vitro as in Tris buffer. This interaction between soman and beta-cyclodextrin, and other data from the literature, suggests that the introduction of catalytic or noncatalytic groups on beta-cyclodextrin might possibly make it a better catalyst for soman inactivation through improvement in the catalytic or in the binding process."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Aspirin acetylsalicylic acid and its metabolite salicylate, have an anti-melanoma effect by evoking mitochondrial dysfunction through poorly understood mechanisms. Depolarization of the plasma membrane potential leads to voltage-gated Ca2 entry VGCE and caspase-3 activation. In the present study, we investigated the role of depolarization and VGCE in aspirins anti-melanoma effect. Aspirin and to a lesser extent, salicylate 2.5 mM induced a rapid within seconds depolarization, while they caused comparable levels of depolarization with a lag of 24 h. Reactive oxygen species ROS generation also occurred in the two-time points, and antioxidants abolished the early ROS generation and depolarization. At the same concentrations, the two drugs induced apoptotic and necrotic cell death in a caspase-independent manner, and antioxidants and Ca2 channel blockers prevented cell death. Besides ROS generation, reduced mitochondrial Ca2 Ca2m and mitochondrial membrane potential preceded cell death. Moreover, the cells expressed the Cav1.2 isoform of l-type Ca2 channel, and knockdown of Cav1.2 abolished the decrease in Ca2m. Our findings suggest that aspirin and salicylate induce Ca2m remodeling, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death via ROS-dependent depolarization and VGCE activation."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",estrogen receptor activity,"Serially propagated with 3T3 feeder layer support, epithelial cells derived from normal rat endometrium expressed estrogen receptor activity. Specific binding of 17-beta-estradiol was in the range of 30-60 fmol/mg of protein and was of high affinity Kd = 0.3 nM. A survey of cell lines derived from several other normal epithelia showed that rat vaginal and human cervical cultures also had high-affinity estrogen receptors 6-13 fmol/mg of protein, while rat epidermal and esophageal cells had no detectable activity. In the endometrial cultures, receptor levels were elevated nearly two- to fourfold by cholera toxin or forskolin in the medium. This effect was detectable after 4 hr but not 1 hr of treatment and did not occur in the presence of cycloheximide. We conclude that serially cultivated rat endometrial cells retain hormonal properties expressed in vivo while exhibiting some keratinocyte character. These cells may provide a useful model for study of receptor modulation."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"AIMS To characterize and identify a novel Huperzine A HupA-producing fungal strain Slf14 isolated from Huperzia serrata Thunb. ex Murray Trev. in China.   METHODS AND RESULTS The isolation, identification and characterization of a novel endophytic fungus producing HupA specifically and consistently from the leaves of H. serrata were investigated. The fungus was identified as Shiraia sp. Slf14 by molecular and morphological methods. The HupA produced by this endophytic fungus was shown to be identical to authentic HupA analysed by thin layer chromatographic, High-performance liquid chromatography HPLC, LC-MS, 1 H NMR and acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition activity in vitro. The amount of HupA produced by Shiraia sp. Slf14 was quantified to be 327.8 g l-1 by HPLC, which was far higher than that of the reported endophytic fungi, Acremonium sp., Blastomyces sp. and Botrytis sp.   CONCLUSIONS The production of HupA by endophyte Shiraia sp. Slf14 is an enigmatic observation. It would be interesting to further study the HupA production and regulation by the cultured endophyte in H. serrata and in axenic cultures.   SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY Although the current accumulation of HupA by the endophyte is not very high, it could provide a promising alterative approach for large-scale production of HupA. However, further strain improvement and the fermentation process optimization are required to result in the consistent and dependable production."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",estrogen receptor activity,"A number of environmental pollutants, including 4-tert-alkylphenols, can mimic the actions of endogenous steroids and have the potential to disrupt the endocrine function in humans and animals. The biotransformation of a 4-tert-alkylphenol in isolated rat hepatocytes was studied in order to determine the possible fate and activity of these xenoestrogens in higher vertebrates. Hepatocytes were incubated with 30 microM 4-1,1,3, 3-tetramethylbutylU-14Cphenol 4-tert-octylphenol t-OP for up to 60 min. Radiolabelled metabolites were detected by radio-HPLC and the structures determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry GC-MS analysis of the conjugated or aglycone products. After a 15 min incubation, over 97 of t-OP was metabolised to a complex mixture of metabolites. The initial metabolites formed were identified as products of hydroxylation of the aromatic ring to form catechols and methylated catechols, as well as glucuronide conjugates of the catechol metabolites or parent phenol. These products were further metabolised by hydroxylation of the alkyl chain followed by glucuronide conjugation of the alkoxy group. The conjugated metabolites of t-OP are unlikely to retain estrogen receptor activity, however t-OP is metabolised by some pathways that are similar to that of estrogen catabolism, namely by ortho-hydroxylation to form catechols, methylation by catechol O-methyltransferases and ring conjugation by uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferases. Further investigations are needed to determine whether 4-tert-alkylphenols can alter circulating sex steroid profiles by acting as substrates of enzymes determining estrogen metabolism and excretion."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"The development of postsynaptic potentiation PSP and desensitization DS under the nonquantal secretion NS of acetylcholine ACh was studied using characteristics of miniature end-plate currents MEPCs in mice diaphragm muscle. The H-effect the measure of the NS level fell to zero during 3 hours after acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition by armine at 20 degrees C. The MEPCs decay time constant tau decreased in parallel with the H-effect, though there was no reduction of the MEPCs amplitude in this case tau did not change when NS was absent early denervation. The maximal prolongation of tau after AChE inhibition was the same both in innervated NS was normal and denervated NS was absent muscle. The reduction of tau accelerated with the temperature rise and occurred after AChE inhibition by neostigmine. There was no changes in tau when AChE was active. It is suggested that nonquantal ACh decreases tau due to the DS development. NS induces no significant PSP after the AChE inhibition, but can do it later according to DS development, so that signs of DS may partially be masked by PSP."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Dihydroartemisinin DHA, a front-line antimalarial herbal compound, has been shown to possess promising anticancer activity with low toxicity. We have previously reported that DHA induced caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in human lung adenocarcinoma cells. However, the cellular target and molecular mechanism of DHA-induced apoptosis is still poorly defined. We use confocal fluorescence microscopy imaging, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching techniques to explore the roles of DHA-elicited reactive oxygen species ROS in the DHA-induced Bcl-2 family proteins activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, caspase cascade, and cell death. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and flow cytometry analysis showed that DHA induced ROS-mediated apoptosis. Confocal imaging analysis in a single living cell and Western blot assay showed that DHA triggered ROS-dependent Bax translocation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, alteration of mitochondrial morphology, cytochrome c release, caspase-9, caspase-8, and caspase-3 activation, indicating the coexistence of ROS-mediated mitochondrial and death receptor pathway. Collectively, our findings demonstrate for the first time that DHA induces cell apoptosis by triggering ROS-mediated caspase-8/Bid activation and the mitochondrial pathway, which provides some novel insights into the application of DHA as a potential anticancer drug and a new therapeutic strategy by targeting ROS signaling in lung adenocarcinoma therapy in the future."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",PPARgamma activation,"OBJECTIVES Impaired epithelial expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma PPARgamma has been described in animal colitis models and briefly in patients with ulcerative colitis, but the functional significance in humans is not well defined. We examined PPARgamma expression and functional activity in human colonic epithelium and explored the potential of topical treatment with rosiglitazone a PPARgamma ligand in patients with ulcerative colitis.   METHODS Spontaneous and rosiglitazone-mediated PPARgamma and adipophillin expression a gene transcriptionally activated by PPARgamma were measured by reverse transcriptase PCR in colonic biopsies and isolated epithelial cells from patients with ulcerative colitis and controls. Fourteen patients with active distal ulcerative colitis were randomized to either rosiglitazone 4 mg or mesalazine 1 g enema treatment once daily for 14 days.   RESULTS PPARgamma expression was fourfold reduced in epithelial cells from inflamed compared with uninflamed mucosa and controls. Adipophillin levels were decreased in parallel. Rosiglitazone induced a concentration-dependent increase in adipophillin levels and restored PPARgamma activity in epithelial cells from inflamed mucosa in vitro. Rosiglitazone enema treatment was well tolerated and reduced the Mayo ulcerative colitis score from 8.9 to 4.3 Plt0.01, similar to the effect of mesalazine. Rosiglitazone increased adipophillin levels in the epithelial cells of the patients, indicating PPARgamma activation in vivo.   CONCLUSIONS Roziglitasone enemas improve impaired PPARgamma activity in inflamed colonic epithelium and have beneficial clinical effect in patients with active distal ulcerative colitis. These findings raise interest in further studies of PPARgamma ligands that exhibit their anti-inflammatory effect locally in the gut to avoid possible systemic side effects."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Bladder cancer is a highly recurrent cancer after intravesical therapy, so new drugs are needed to treat this cancer. Hence, we investigated the anti-cancer activity of combretastatin A-4 CA-4, an anti-tubulin agent, in human bladder cancer cells and in a murine orthotopic bladder tumour model.   EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Cytotoxicity of CA-4 was measured by 3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide MTT assay, propidium iodide PI staining assay and clonogenic survival assay. In vivo microtubule assembly assay, cell cycle analyses, Western blot and cell migration assay were used to study the mechanism of CA-4. The effect of intravesical CA-4 therapy on the development of tumours was studied in the murine orthotopic bladder tumour model.   KEY RESULTS CA-4 inhibited microtubule polymerization in vivo. Cytotoxic IC50 values of CA-4 in human bladder cancer cells were below 4 nM. Analyses of cell-cycle distribution showed CA-4 obviously induced G2-M phase arrest with sub-G1 formation. The analyses of apoptosis showed that CA-4 induced caspase-3 activation and decreased BubR1 and Bub3 in cancer cells. In addition to apoptosis, CA-4 was also found to induce the formation of multinucleated cells. CA-4 had a significantly reduced cell migration in vitro. Importantly, the in vivo study revealed that intravesical CA-4 therapy retarded the development of murine bladder tumours.   CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS These data demonstrate that CA-4 kills bladder cancer cells by inducing apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe. It inhibited cell migration in vitro and tumour growth in vivo. Hence, CA-4 intravesical therapy could provide another strategy for treating superficial bladder cancers."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Keratinization is a kind of cell death called terminal differentiation and includes various patterns such as epidermal keratinization EK, trichilemmal keratinization TK, and shadow cell differentiation SCD, whereas these have not been comparatively investigated from a standpoint of cell death. In the present study, surgically extirpated specimens of epidermal cyst, trichilemmal cyst, and pilomatricoma 10 cases in each were subjected to immunohistochemistry for single-strand DNA ssDNA, gamma-H2AX, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved lamin A, caspase-14, and CD138 to compare the modes of cell death and keratinization pattern. Transitional cells in pilomatricoma were immunoreactive, although not in whole part, for ssDNA and gamma-H2AX, and negative for cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved lamin A. Epidermal and trichilemmal cyst were negative for these 4 markers, except for ssDNA or cleaved lamin A in a small number of parakeratotic cells in a few cases. The keratinizing component showed caspase-14/CD138- in epidermal cyst, caspase-14-/CD138 in trichilemmal cyst, and caspase-14-/CD138- in pilomatricoma. These results indicate that EK, TK, and SCD have a common property of apoptosis-like programmed cell death without caspase-3 activation or nuclear fragmentation. Meanwhile, they show different characteristics one another as follows A, DNA double-strand breaks occur in the transitional cells of SCD but not in EK/TK and B, EK, TK, and SCD can be distinguished by expression pattern of caspase-14 and CD138 in the keratinizing component."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"The reported investigations were carried out on female Wistar rats receiving chlorphenvinphos and phospholine in doses equalling 3/4 LD50 onto the skin and intragastrically. the levels of acetylcholinesterase AChE were determined in the erythrocytes, liver and tibialis muscle and in three brain areas pontomedullary area, hypothalamus and cerebral cortex. The activity of the enzyme was determined 15 and 30 minutes, and 3, 24 and 72 hours after poisoning. A high degree of AChE inhibition was observed in the brain after chlorphenvinphos poisoning activity fall to 15--30 and a slight decrease of AChE activity after administration of phospholine independently of the route. After oral poisoning with both preparations the AChE activity level in the erythrocytes was from about 27 to 31, in the liver from 18 to 23, and in the skeletal muscle from 51 to 54, while with the transcutaneous route of poisoning these values were 18--23, 41--52, and 36--48 respectively. A high degree of enzyme restoration was observed during 72 hours of observation. AChE activity was then 60--80 of the initial value."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"Upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF expression induced by hypoxia is crucial event leading to neovascularization. Cyclooxygenase-2, an inducible enzyme that catalyzes the formation of prostaglandins PGs from arachidonic acid, has been demonstrated to be induced by hypoxia and play role in angiogenesis and metastasis. To investigate the potential effect of COX-2 on hypoxia-induced VEGF expression in prostate cancer. We examined the relationship between COX-2 expression and VEGF induction in response to cobalt chloride CoCl2-simulated hypoxia in three human prostate cancer cell lines with differing biological phenotypes. Northern blotting and ELISA revealed that all three tested cell lines constitutively expressed VEGF mRNA, and secreted VEGF protein to different degrees LNCaP gt PC-3 gt PC3ML. However, these cell lines differed in the ability to produce VEGF in the presence of CoCl2-simulated hypoxia. CoCl2 treatment resulted in 40 and 75 increases in VEGF mRNA, and 50 and 95 in protein secretion by LNCaP and PC-3 cell lines, respectively. In contrast, PC-3ML cell line, a PC-3 subline with highly invasive, metastatic phenotype, exhibits a dramatic upregulation of VEGF, 5.6-fold in mRNA and 6.3-fold in protein secretion after treatment with CoCl2. The upregulation of VEGF in PC-3ML cells is accompanied by a persistent induction of COX-2 mRNA 6.5-fold and protein 5-fold. Whereas COX-2 expression is only transiently induced in PC-3 cells and not affected by CoCl2 in LNCaP cells. Moreover, the increases in VEGF mRNA and protein secretion induced by CoCl2 in PC-3ML cells were significantly suppressed following exposure to NS398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor. Finally, the effect of COX-2 inhibition on CoCl2-induced VEGF production was reversed by the treatment with exogenous PGE2. Our data demonstrate that VEGF induction by cobalt chloride-simulated hypoxia is maintained by a concomitant, persistent induction of COX-2 expression and sustained elevation of PGE2 synthesis in a human metastatic prostate cancer cell line, and suggest that COX-2 activity, reflected by PGE2 production, is involved in hypoxia-induced VEGF expression, and thus, modulates prostatic tumor angiogenesis."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Photodynamic therapy PDT using the silicon phthalocyanine photosensitizer Pc 4 HOSiPcOSiCH32CH23N-CH32 is an oxidative stress associated with induction of apoptosis in various cell types. We assessed the effectiveness of Pc 4-PDT on SW480 colon cancer xenografts grown in athymic nude mice. Animals bearing xenografts were treated with 1 mg/kg body weight Pc 4 and 48 h later were irradiated with 150 J/cm2 672-nm light from a diode laser delivered at 150 mW/cm2. Biochemical studies were performed in xenografts resected at various time points up to 26 h after Pc 4-PDT treatment, whereas tumor size was evaluated over a 4-week period in parallel experiments. In the tumors resected for biochemical studies, apoptosis was visualized by activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and a gradual increase in the cleavage of the nuclear enzyme polyADP-ribose polymerase PARP to a maximum of approximately 60 of the total PARP present at approximately 26 h. At that time all Pc 4-PDT-treated tumors had regressed significantly. Two signaling responses that have previously been shown to be associated with Pc 4-PDT-induced apoptosis in cultured cells, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and p21/WAF1/Cip1, were examined. A marked increase in phosphorylation of p38 was observed within 1 h after Pc 4-PDT without changes in levels of the p38 protein. Levels of p21 were not altered in the xenografts in correspondence with the presence of mutant p53 in SW480 cells. Evaluation of tumor size showed that tumor growth resumed after a delay of 9-15 days. Our results suggest that a Pc 4-PDT is effective in the treatment of SW480 human colon cancer xenografts independent of p53 status b PARP cleavage may be mediated by caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation in the Pc 4-PDT-treated tumors and c p38 phosphorylation may be a trigger of apoptosis in response to PDT in vivo in this tumor model."

Their chemical structures were characterized by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance NMR, 13 C NMR, and high-resolution mass spectra. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated in terms of acetylcholineasterase AChE and human carbonic anhydrases hCA I and II isoenzymes inhibitory activities. According to the AChE inhibition results, the Ki values of the compounds 1-9 were in the range of 19.9  1.5 to 96.5  20.7 nM against AChE. Tacrine was used as the reference drug and its Ki value was 49.2  2.7 nM against AChE. The Ki values of the compounds 1-9 were in the range of 10.2  2.6 to 101.4  27.8 nM against hCA I, whereas they were 18.3  4.4 to 48.1  4.5 nM against hCA II. Acetazolamide was used as a reference drug and its Ki values were 72.2  5.4 and 52.2  5.7 nM against hCA I and hCA II, respectively. The most active compounds, 1 nonsubstituted against AChE, 5 4-ethoxy-substituted against hCA I, and 8 4-bromo-substituted against hCA II, were chosen and docked at the binding sites of these enzymes to explain the inhibitory activities of the series. The newly synthesized compounds presented satisfactory pharmacokinetic properties via the estimation of ADME properties."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Acute lung injury ALI and the development of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome MODS are major causes of death in trauma patients. Gut inflammation and loss of gut barrier function as a consequence of splanchnic ischemia-reperfusion I/R have been implicated as the initial triggering events that contribute to the development of the systemic inflammatory response, ALI, and MODS. Since hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1 is a key regulator of the physiological and pathophysiological response to hypoxia, we asked whether HIF-1 plays a proximal role in the induction of gut injury and subsequent lung injury. Utilizing partially HIF-1-deficient mice in a global trauma hemorrhagic shock T/HS model, we found that HIF-1 activation was necessary for the development of gut injury and that the prevention of gut injury was associated with an abrogation of lung injury. Specifically, in vivo studies demonstrated that partial HIF-1 deficiency ameliorated T/HS-induced increases in intestinal permeability, bacterial translocation, and caspase-3 activation. Lastly, partial HIF-1 deficiency reduced TNF-, IL-1, cyclooxygenase-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase levels in the ileal mucosa after T/HS whereas IL-1 mRNA levels were reduced in the lung after T/HS. This study indicates that prolonged intestinal HIF-1 activation is a proximal regulator of I/R-induced gut mucosal injury and gut-induced lung injury. Consequently, these results provide unique information on the initiating events in trauma-hemorrhagic shock-induced ALI and MODS as well as potential therapeutic insights."

The anticancer activities in vitro and the cell apoptosis-induction abilities of SMT-A07 on human leukemia HL60 and NB4 cell lines were investigated in this study. The results of MTT assay showed SMT-A07 was a potential and highly efficient antitumor compound with IC50 values ranging from 0.09 to 1.19 M in five leukemia cell lines. SMT-A07 treatment for 24 h caused the increment of apoptosis rate from 6.88 to 49.72 in HL60 cells and from 8.72 to 56.28 in NB4 cells by flow cytometry analysis. Agarose gel electrophoresis showed DNA fragmentation that appeared after cells were exposed to SMT-A07. After SMT-A07 incubation, DAPI staining revealed the presence of DNA fragmentation, and perinuclear apoptotic body. SMT-A07 also resulted in a loss of m in both HL60 and NB4 cells by JC-1 staining. Moreover, apoptosis-related proteins were examined by western blotting to explore the mechanism of its cytotoxicity. SMT-A07 exposure caused down-regulation and cleavage of procaspase-8, procaspase-3, Bid, PARP and up-regulation of cleaved caspase-8, cleaved caspase-3, PARP Cleaved Fragment. In addition, the presence of pan-caspase inhibitor BOC-D-FMK prevented cells from caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, and subsequent apoptosis. Our study demonstrates that SMT-A07 displays an apparent antitumor activity with extensive anti-leukemia spectrum, and SMT-A07 can induce the apoptosis of HL60 and NB4 cells activation of the caspase cascade, which deserves further development."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"AIMS We had previously reported that addition of putrescine to the culture medium was reported to reduce methylmercury toxicity in C17.2 neural stem cells. Here, we have examined the inhibition of methylmercury-induced cytotoxicity by putrescine using ODC1-overexpressing C17.2 cells.   MATERIALS AND METHODS We established stable ODC1-overexpressing C17.2 cells and evaluated methylmercury-induced apoptosis by examining the TUNEL assay and cleaved caspase-3 levels. Mitochondria-mediated apoptosis was also evaluated by reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential and recruitment of Bax and Bak to the mitochondria.   KEY FINDINGS ODC is encoded by ODC1 gene, and putrescine levels in ODC1-overexpressing cells were significantly higher than in control cells. Overexpression of ODC1 and addition of putrescine to the culture medium suppressed DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation, which are observed when apoptosis is induced by methylmercury. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species ROS generation, caused by methylmercury, were also inhibited by the overexpression of ODC1 and putrescine pretreatment with ODC inhibitor, however, promoted both ROS generation and apoptosis by methylmercury. Finally, we found that Bax and Bak, the apoptosis-promoting factors, to be increased in mitochondria, following methylmercury treatment, and the same was inhibited by overexpression of ODC1. These results suggest that overexpression of ODC1 may prevent mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by methylmercury via increase of putrescine levels.   SIGNIFICANCE Our findings provide important clues to clarify mechanisms involved in the defense against methylmercury toxicity and suggest novel biological functions of putrescine."

The potential cytotoxic activity of these compounds investigated in leukemia cell lines by Differential Nuclear Staining DNS. Our results identified two compounds, 2-4-methoxybenzyl-6-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-ylimidazo2,1-b1,3,4thiadiazol-5-yl thiocyanate and 6-4-chlorophenyl-2-4-methoxybenzylimidazo2,1-b1,3,4thiadiazole-5-carbaldehyde, exhibited the most cytotoxic effect against murine leukemia cells L1210, human T-lymphocyte cells CEM and human cervix carcinoma cells HeLa with IC50 values ranging between 0.79 and 1.6 M. The results indicate that 2-4-methoxybenzyl-6-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-ylimidazo2,1-b1,3,4thiadiazol-5-yl thiocyanate is inducing phosphatidylserine externalization and caspase-3 activation which are both a hallmark of apoptosis. Docking studies showed that 2-4-methoxybenzyl-6-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-ylimidazo2,1-b1,3,4thiadiazol-5-yl thiocyanate binds within the active sites of transforming growth factor beta TGF- type I receptor kinase domain by strong hydrogen binding and hydrophobic interactions."

The compounds were evaluated for their apoptotic effects against HeLa-C3 cells, which have been genetically engineered to produce a fluorescent biosensor capable of detecting caspase-3 activation. Compounds 1 and 3-9 activate caspase-3 in HeLa-C3 cells within 72 h after treatment at a concentration of 100 microM or lower.

"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"The neurotoxicity and lethality of Soman and Sarin, after single and repeated treatment at 50-60 of their LD50 doses in rats were investigated. Single treatment with Soman 100 micrograms/kg and Sarin 120 micrograms/kg produced severe tremors, convulsions and hypothermia, in some rats only, while the others did not show toxicity, i.e. an all or none effect. Soman and Sarin 100-120 micrograms/kg caused, respectively, 89-93 and 26-48 inhibition of AChE at 6 hr and 56-68 and 17-39 inhibition at 24 h after single injections. Repeated treatment with Soman 90 micrograms/kg and Sarin 100 micrograms/kg at 4 day intervals caused variable incidences of neurotoxicity and increasing mortalities, and after ten injections the survival rates were 31 and 54, and AChE inhibition was 86 and 75, respectively. It is suggested, that the variable neurotoxicity of and the low tolerance to of these compounds are partly related to peripheral dispositional mechanisms. Furthermore, the profile of toxicity of these anticholinesterase agents should be differentiated from, but not generalized with, that of the other anticholinesterase organophosphates."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS Purinergic receptors are a family of newly characterized plasma membrane molecules involved in several and as yet only partially known cellular functions such as vascular reactivity, apoptosis and cytokine secretion. Little is known about the effect extracellular microenvironment has on their function. Fibroblasts share several features with smooth muscle cells and are an important constituent of the atherosclerotic plaque. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of high glucose concentration on ATP-mediated responses in human fibroblasts.   METHODS Fibroblasts were obtained by skin biopsies and grown at two different glucose concentrations. We evaluated receptor expression by RT-PCR and immunoblotting and receptor localization by immunofluorescence. Plasma membrane potential and calcium changes were measured by fluorescent indicators. Apoptosis was determined by ethidium bromide staining and caspase-3 activation.   RESULTS We show that cells grown in a medium with high glucose concentration underwent great ATP-mediated morphological changes, enhanced apoptosis, caspase 3 activation and interleukin-6 release. We identified P2X7 as the main purinergic receptor involved in these responses. Furthermore, high glucose concentration triggered the assembly of P2X7 into ring-like structures located at the periphery of the cells.   CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION Given that ATP is frequently released into the extracellular milieu upon cell and tissue damage, secretory exocytosis or activation of plasma membrane transporters, we hypothesize that ATP receptors participate in the pathogenesis of vascular complications of diabetes."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Targeting DNA mismatch repair-deficient/KRAS-mutant Colorectal Cancer Stem Cells CRCSCs with chemical compounds remains challenging. Modulating stemness factors Bmi-1, Sox-2, Oct-4 and Nanog in CRCSCs which are direct downstream targets of carcinogenesis pathways may lead to the reactivation of caspase-3 and apoptosis in these cells. Omega-3 DHA modulates different signaling pathways involved in carcinogenesis. However, little is known, whether in vitro concentrations of DHA equal to human plasma levels are able to modulate pluripotency genes expression, caspase-3 reactivation and apoptosis in DNA mismatch repair-deficient/KRAS-mutant CRC stem-like cells.   METHODS DNA mismatch repair-deficient/KRAS-mutant CRC stem-like cells LS174T cells were treated with DHA, after which, cell number and proliferation-rate, Bmi-1, Sox-2, Nanog and Oct-4 expression, caspase-3 activation and apoptosis were evaluated with different cellular and molecular techniques.   RESULTS DHA changed the morphology of cells to apoptotic forms and disrupted cell connections. After 48h treatment with 50- to 200M DHA, cell numbers and proliferation-rates were measured to be 86-35 and 93.6-45.7 respectively. Treatment with 200 M DHA dramatically decreased the expression of Bmi-1, Sox- 2, Oct-4 and Nanog by 69, 70, 97.5 and 53 respectively. Concurrently, DHA induced caspase-3 activation by 1.8-4.7-fold increases compared to untreated cells. An increase in the number of apoptotic cells ranging from 9.3-38.4 was also observed with increasing DHA concentrations.   CONCLUSIONS DHA decreases the high expression level of pluripotency network genes suggesting Bmi-1, Sox-2, Oct-4 and Nanog as promising molecular targets of DHA. DHA reactivates caspase-3 and apoptosis in DNA mismatch repair-deficient/KRAS-mutant CRC stem-like cells, representing the high potential of this safe compound for therapeutic application in CRC."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 HSV-1 is ubiquitous, neurotropic, and the most common pathogenic causes of sporadic acute encephalitis in humans. Herpes simplex encephalitis is associated with a high mortality rate and significant neurological, neuropsychological, and neurobehavioral sequelae, which afflict patients for life. HSV-1 infects limbic system structures in the central nervous system and has been suggested as an environmental risk factor for Alzheimers disease. However, the possible mechanisms that link HSV-1 infection with the neurodegenerative process are still largely unknown. In a previous study we demonstrated that HSV-1 triggers hyperphosphorylation of tau epitopes serine202/threonine205 and serine396/serine404 in neuronal cultures, resembling what occurs in neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate at the cellular level if another event associated with neurodegeneration, such as caspase-3 induced cleavage of tau, could also be triggered by HSV-1 infection in primary neuronal and astrocyte cultures. As expected, induction of caspase-3 activation and cleavage of tau protein at its specific site aspartic acid 421 was observed by Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses in mice neuronal primary cultures infected with HSV-1. In agreement with our previous study on tau hyperphosphorylation, tau cleavage was also observed during the first 4 hours of infection, before neuronal death takes place. This tau processing has been previously demonstrated to increase the kinetics of tau aggregation in vitro and has also been observed in neurodegenerative pathologies. In conclusion, our findings support the idea that HSV-1 could contribute to induce neurodegenerative processes in age-associated pathologies such as Alzheimers disease."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"The polyphosphoinositides play important roles in transmembrane signalling but are also involved in anchoring cell surface proteins, organellar transport, cytoskeleton organization, and cell survival. The polyphosphoinositides synthesized by phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase PI-3K, Ptd3,4InsP2, and PtdIns3,4,5P3, appear to play a critical role in cell survival by membrane recruitment and activation of Akt kinase. Inhibitors of PI3K, wortmannin, and LY294002, induced a time-dependent activation of caspase-3 CPP32, with a peak at 6 hr, leading to subsequent cell death by apoptosis in a dorsal root ganglion cell line F-11. Lowering cyclic AMP cAMP levels enhanced both caspase-3 activation and cell death induced by PI3K inhibitors, whereas a nonhydrolyzable cAMP analog Bt2cAMP, lowered CPP32 and was protective. We stably transfected the F-11 cells with the constitutively active p110 catalytic subunit of PI-3 kinase and observed resistance to both caspase-3 CPP32 activation and subsequent apoptosis induced by either wortmannin or LY294002. Treatment of F-11 cells with bradykinin BK stimulated the hydrolysis of a different polyphosphoinositide, PtdIns4,5P2, and enhanced both wortmannin-induced caspase-3 CPP32 activation and subsequent apoptosis. PtdIns4,5P2 is also a precursor of the anti-apoptotic PtdIns3,4,5 P3 and lowering cAMP levels with opioid agonists for 30 min enhanced both the hydrolysis of PtdIns4,5 P2 and cellular apoptosis. The enhancement was opioid dose-dependent and opioid antagonist naloxone-reversible and was also seen following 24-hr exposure to opioids such as U69,593 and Dala2, Dleu5 enkephalin DADLE. However, unlike the bradykinin stimulation of PtdIns4,5P2 hydrolysis following activation of phospholipase C, the opioid-enhanced hydrolysis was independent of external Ca2 and was blocked by pertussis toxin, suggesting a different mechanism involving GI, GO, or betagamma-subunits. In summary, both the receptor-mediated lowering of cAMP levels and the hydrolysis of 4,5-polyphosphoinositides have no direct effect on caspase-3 activity or apoptosis but do exacerbate the activation of caspase-3-like activity and subsequent cell death by apoptosis induced by inhibitors of 3-polyphosphoinositide synthesis. We suggest that multiple polyphosphoinositide pathways are involved in the regulation of apoptosis."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"We have investigated cell killing in cultured rat embryonic cortical neurons exposed to the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine, the excitatory amino acid N-methyl-D-aspartate NMDA, or a combination thereof. Our data indicate that there are several populations of neurons that differ in their response to these agents. Cultures exposed to NMDA undergo cell death typified by lactate dehydrogenase LDH leakage which is likely primarily necrotic in that little caspase-3 activation or oligonucleosome formation is observed even when followed for 48 h. Cells exposed to staurosporine STS exhibit rapid, extensive activation of caspase-3 with coincident LDH leakage, oligonucleosome formation and TUNEL staining. Both LDH leakage and oligonucleosome content were significantly more elevated at 48 h than at 20 h with STS treatment while caspase-3 activity peaked early 8-20 h and declined markedly by 48 h. Deletion of NMDA-responsive neurons by pre-treatment of the cultures with NMDA for 4 days prevented the late phase 20-48 h increases in LDH leakage and oligonucleosomes in the remaining neuronal population. Caspase-3 activity was also completely abolished by NMDA pre-treatment. These results indicate that cells susceptible to acute NMDA-induced toxicity can be killed by non-apoptotic means when exposed to NMDA however, they undergo a delayed, apoptotic death when exposed to STS. Interestingly, removal of NMDA-responsive cells prevents the processing of procaspase-3 thus, STS-induced apoptosis in cells resistant to NMDA-mediated killing proceeds independent of caspase-3 activation. The data indicate that nearly all neurons in these mixed cultures can undergo apoptosis in response to appropriate stimuli such as STS but that the temporal nature, and the pathways activated in response to STS, vary amongst the subpopulations of neurons. These findings may help to explain the simultaneous appearance of features of both apoptosis and necrosis observed in vivo following cerebral ischemia."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the involvement of acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition in hyperglycemic and stressogenic effects of monocrotophos in rats. Oral administration of monocrotophos 1.8 mg/kg b.w., 1/10 LD50 caused reversible hyperglycemia in rats with peak increase occurring at 2 h following administration. The hyperglycemic outcome at 2 h was accompanied by significant inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE activity in brain 84, adrenal 68 and liver 53 and stressogenic effects as revealed by marked increase in plasma corticosterone 102 and liver tyrosine aminotransferase TAT 104 activity. At 4 h following administration, there was normalization of hyperglycemia and hypercorticosteronemia, marginal attenuation of liver TAT activity and marked increase in liver glycogen content, without spontaneous reactivation of AChE activity in the organs studied. Interestingly, pre-treatment of rats with acetylcholine ACh receptor antagonists-atropine sulfate and methyl atropine nitrate offered significant protection against hyperglycemia, hypercorticosteronemia and increased liver TAT activity induced by monocrotophos. Our results clearly demonstrate the involvement of AChE inhibition in hyperglycemia and stressogenic effects of monocrotophos in rats following acute exposure. Protection offered by both, general and peripheral ACh antagonists provide further evidence for the involvement of peripheral AChE inhibition in the monocrotophos-induced effects."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Diabetes is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease, and the high prevalence of sympathetic nervous system SNS hyperactivity in diabetic patients makes them further susceptible to SNS-mediated oxidative stress and accelerated kidney damage. Here, we investigated if canagliflozin can reverse isoprenaline ISO-induced renal oxidative damage in rats, a model that mimics SNS overstimulation-induced organ injuries in humans. We found that ISO administration elevates renal oxidative stress markers including malondialdehyde MDA, advanced protein oxidation product APOP, myeloperoxidase MPO and nitric oxide NO, while depleting levels of endogenous antioxidants such as catalase CAT, superoxide dismutase SOD and glutathione GSH. Strikingly, canagliflozin treatment of ISO-treated rats not only prevents elevation of oxidative stress markers but also rescues levels of depleted antioxidants. Our results also show that canagliflozin stimulates antioxidant/anti-inflammatory signaling pathways involving AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK, Akt and eNOS, and inhibits iNOS and NADPH oxidase isoform 4 NOX4, all of which are associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. Further, canagliflozin prevents ISO-induced apoptosis of kidney cells by inhibiting Bax protein upregulation and caspase-3 activation. Histological examination of kidney sections reveal that canagliflozin attenuates ISO-mediated increases in inflammatory cell infiltration, collagen deposition and fibrosis. Finally, consistent with these findings, canagliflozin treatment improves kidney function in ISO-treated rats, suggesting that the antioxidant effects may be clinically translatable."

RhoA signal pathway plays important roles in dendritic development by regulating cytoskeleton protein such as tubulin and actin. However, its not clear whether RhoA pathway is involved in inhaled general anesthetics sevoflurane-induced synaptic development abnormalities and long-term cognitive dysfunction. Rats at postnatal day 7 PND7 were injected intraperitoneally with RhoA pathway inhibitor Y27632 or saline 20 min before exposed to 2.8 sevoflurane for 4 h. The apoptosis-related proteins and RhoA/CRMP2 pathway proteins in the hippocampus were measured 6 h after sevoflurane exposure. Cognitive functions were evaluated by the open field test on PND25 rats and contextual fear conditioning test on PND32-33 rats. The dendritic morphology and density of dendritic spines in the pyramidal neurons of hippocampus were determined by Golgi staining and the synaptic plasticity-related proteins were also measured on PND33 rats. Long term potentiation LTP from hippocampal slices was recorded on PND34-37 rats. Sevoflurane induced caspase-3 activation, decreased the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax and increased TUNEL-positive neurons in hippocampus of PND7 rats, which were attenuated by inhibition of RhoA. However, sevoflurane had no significant effects on activity of RhoA/CRMP2 pathway. Sevoflurane disturbed dendritic morphogenesis, reduced the number of dendritic spines, decreased proteins expression of PSD-95, drebrin and synaptophysin, inhibited LTP in hippocampal slices and impaired memory ability in the adolescent rats, while inhibition of RhoA activity did not rescue the changes above induced by sevoflurane. RhoA signal pathway did not participate in sevoflurane-induced dendritic and synaptic development abnormalities and cognitive dysfunction in developing rats."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Cultured embryonic E7 chick neurons, derived from cerebral hemispheres, underwent apoptosis in response to inhibitors of protein kinase C staurosporine and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase wortmannin and LY294002, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This was monitored by loss of cell viability, increased DNA fragmentation, and activation of caspase-3-like activity, all of which were partially reversed by elevating the level of cAMP in the cells with Bt2cAMP or SpcAMPS. Further studies revealed that an early step in apoptosis was the formation of ceramide from sphingomyelin, resulting from the activation of a neutral pH sphingomyelinase activity. Thus inhibitors of protein kinase C and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase increased ceramide levels in the same time-frame as caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. Neurons could also be killed by the addition of either water-soluble C2-ceramide 30 microM or natural C22/24 ceramide 0.5 microM. In contrast to the apparent protective effect of ser/thr protein phosphorylation, a pro-apoptotic role for tyrosine phosphate phosphorylation was suggested by the ability of protein tyrosine phosphate phosphatase inhibitor, Bismaltolatooxovanadium IV BMOV, to induce apoptosis in E7CH neurons. Thus BMOV 25 microM killed 50 of E7CH neurons and B lymphocytes but not glial cells, or T-lymphocytes, suggesting the existence of a common apoptotic pathway in neurons and B-cells. We conclude that the major pathway for programmed cell death in embryonic chick neurons has many elements in common with that described for other cells but that there may be some unique aspects which can be used to protect embryonic neurons from opioid and other drug-enhanced apoptosis."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Background An earlier study demonstrated significant antioxidant and anticholinesterase activities of hydromethanol extract HME of Allium cepa. The aim of the study was to investigate the component responsible for these activities followed by an in vivo study. Methods In vitro antioxidant and anticholinesterase activities of standardized ethylacetate fraction EAF of HME were assessed. Bioactivity-guided fractionation showed that, as compared with its subfractions, EAF had most significant activity in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and Ellman assays. Thus, EAF was further examined using a streptozotocin STZ-induced model of Alzheimers disease in mice. STZ was injected intracerebroventricularly on days 1 and 3 3 mg/kg in mice. EAF was thereafter administered 42, 84, and 168 mg/kg b.w./day p.o. from days 9 to 22. The Morris water maze test was used to evaluate learning and memory in mice. Acetylcholinesterase AChE activity and oxidative stress markers were assessed in the brain homogenates of mice. Additionally, histopathological studies were performed to observe effects in the brain at the cellular level. EAF was standardized based on quercetin and quercetin 4-O-glucoside content using a validated thin layer chromatography densitometric method. Results STZ produced significant p lt 0.05 memory impairment along with oxidative stress and a cholinergic deficit in mice. EAF treatment ameliorated STZ-induced behavioral deficits and biochemical alterations in mice in a significant and dose-dependent manner. Conclusions Our results show that EAF is efficacious in improving memory and learning via AChE inhibition and antioxidant activity in the mice brain. Thus, AC could be explored further to find out a lead candidate for Alzheimers disease."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",EGFR signaling pathway,"Matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9 is an endopeptidase that digests basement membrane type IV collagen. Enhanced expression has been related to tumor progression both in vitro and in vivo. The control of MMP transcription is complex, but recently, epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR expression has been implicated in up-regulation of MMP-9 in tumor cells in vitro. Our objective was to evaluate the relationship between MMP-9 and EGFR expression in non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC and to assess the impact of expression on clinicopathological parameters and survival. This is a retrospective study of 169 patients who underwent resection for stage I-IIIa NSCLC with a postoperative survival gt60 days. Minimum follow-up was 2 years. Standard avidin-biotin complex immunohistochemistry was performed on 4-microm paraffin-embedded sections from the tumor periphery using monoclonal antibodies to EGFR and MMP-9. MMP-9 was expressed in the tumor cells of 88 of 169 52 cases. EGFR expression was found in 94 of 169 56 cases membranous, 55 of 169 33 cytoplasmic, 39 of 169 23. MMP-9 expression was associated with poor outcome in univariate P = 0.0023 and multivariate P = 0.027 analysis. Membranous, cytoplasmic, and overall EGFR expression were not associated with outcome P = 0.13, 0.99, and 0.17, respectively. MMP-9 expression showed a strong correlation with EGFR expression P lt 0.0001 and EGFR membranous expression P = 0.002 but not with cytoplasmic EGFR expression P = 0.18. Co-expression of MMP-9 and EGFR 37 conferred a worse prognosis P = 0.0001. Subset analysis revealed only MMP-9 and membranous EGFR co-expression 22 was associated with poor outcome P = 0.0019. Our results show that a significant proportion of NSCLC tumors co-express MMP-9 and EGFR. The co-expression of these markers confers a poor prognosis. This finding suggests that EGFR signaling pathway may play an important role in the invasive behavior of NSCLC via specific up-regulation of MMP-9."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",Cyclooxygenase inhibition,"AVP10-8-10-6M increased ACTH as well as PGE2 release from rat anterior pituitary quarters in vitro in a concentration dependent manner. IBMX 0.1 mM, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, increased the ACTH response to AVP. The cAMP content in pituitary tissue was increased by AVP. Cyclooxygenase inhibition by indomethacin1.4 X 10-5 M or diclofenac 1.8 X 10-5M led to a potentiation of AVP-evoked ACTH secretion and to a decrease in AVP-stimulated cAMP formation. PGE210-6M significantly increased pituitary cAMP content and indomethacin did not affect cAMP levels activated by PGE2. PGE2 attenuated the AVP-induced ACTH release. These results indicate that at least two functional compartments of AVP-activated cAMP responses are involved in the AVP-induced ACTH release. One compartment is directly activated by AVP and participates in the propagation of AVP-induced ACTH release. The second compartment is activated by PGE2. The contribution of the second compartment to the regulation of ACTH secretion is not well understood since PGE2 shows an inhibitory effect on AVP-induced ACTH secretion."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Previous studies have shown indirectly that the neuromuscular effects of nonselective cholinesterase inhibitors are mediated through the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE. To test this hypothesis more directly we studied the effects of the specific inhibitor of AChE, BW 284c51, at the neuromuscular junction of rat diaphragms. BW 284c51 inhibits AChE in a dose-dependent partially reversible manner at all concentrations tested 10-9 to 10-4 M. Maximum inhibition was never greater than 92. The drug increased miniature end-plate potential MEPP amplitude and prolonged half-decay time at 10-7 and 10-6 M. However, BE 284c51 had no effect on the resting membrane potential at any concentration. BW 284c51 at 10-7 M reversibly increased MEPP frequency by almost 4-fold. There was a 2-fold increase in the occurrence of giant MEPPs in the presence of BW 284c51. The quantum content m of the end-plate potential was increased in 10-7 M BW 284c51 as were end-plate potential amplitude and quantum size q. Animals injected subcutaneously with 10 mg/kg of BW 284c51 displayed typical signs of AChE inhibition including salivation, whole body tremor and prostration. Spontaneous muscle fasciculation was more noticeable after in vivo injection of BW 284c51 than after in vitro administration. Furthermore, MEPP frequencies were considerably faster when the drug was injected in vivo than when applied in vitro. The data are discussed with respect to the hypothesis that inhibition of AChE causes presynaptic as well as postsynaptic effects."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Cassiae semen, a commonly consumed tea and medicinal food, has been shown to have multiple therapeutic actions related to the prevention of dementia and ischemia. In this study, we investigated the effects of extract of Cassiae semen COE against neurotoxicities in in vitro and in vivo Parkinsons disease PD models. In PC12 cells, COE attenuated the cell damage induced by 100 microM 6-hydroxydopamine 6-OHDA stress in MTT assay, and it inhibited the overproduction of reactive oxygen species, glutathione depletion, mitochondrial membrane depolarization and caspase-3 activation at 0.1-10 microg/ml. In addition, COE showed radical scavenging activity in the DPPH and ABTS assays. In mesencephalic dopaminergic DA culture, COE protected DA cells against 10 microM 6-OHDA- and 10 microM 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine-induced toxicities at 0.1-1 microg/ml. We also evaluated the effect of COE in a mouse PD model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine MPTP. In the pole test, COE 50mg/kg, 15 daysMPTP 30 mg/kg, 5 days-treated group had decreased T-turn and T-LA which were longer in MPTP group. Moreover, COE significantly protected DA neuronal degeneration induced by MPTP in the substantia nigra and striatum of these mice. These results demonstrate that COE can prevent DA neurons against the toxicities involved in PD."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Resveratrol is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound present in many plant species and wine. It possesses a wide range of beneficial biological properties including anticancer activity. Resveratrol has been demonstrated to induce both autophagy and apoptosis in several human cancer cell lines. The aim of this study was to investigate whether resveratrol modulates autophagy and apoptosis in MOLT-4 human lymphoblastic leukemia and HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. Cell viability was evaluated by the neutral red uptake assay. Cell cycle distribution, phosphatidylserine externalization, caspase-3 activation, changes of the mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular production of reactive oxygen species were evaluated by flow cytometry. LC3-I to LC3-II conversion was examined based on Western blotting and immunofluorescence analyses. The level of p62/SQSTM1 protein and PARP1 cleavage were analyzed by Western blotting. The DNA degradation was assessed by gel electrophoresis. We found that resveratrol is able to modulate autophagy in MOLT-4 and HL-60 cells, as evidenced by the detection of an increased level of LC3-II and p62/SQSTM1 proteins. Moreover, resveratrol induced apoptosis in both cell lines which was associated with phosphatidylserine externalization, disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-3 activation, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, PARP1 cleavage, chromatin condensation, and fragmentation of cell nuclei. The present study provides evidence that resveratrol can act as an autophagy modulator as well as an apoptosis inducer in MOLT-4 and HL-60 human leukemia cells. Our findings imply that resveratrol can be a promising chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of leukemia."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Sublethal toxicity of car-carbosulfan, 2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-benzofuranyldi-n-butylaminosulfenyl methylcarbamate , was evaluated in female Sprague-Dawley rats. Erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase AChE activity was maximally inhibited 1 min after iv administration 38, 23, and 15 of pretreatment activity after 86, 250, and 690 micrograms/kg, respectively and recovered by 4 hr. Maximum AChE inhibition 63 of pretreatment activity was measured 45 min after oral dosing 690 micrograms/kg and activity recovered after 5 hr. Signs included urination, defecation, facial muscle fasciculations, salivation, and tremors. Carbosulfan was less toxic when given orally. Metabolic activation of carbosulfan to carbofuran 2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-7-benzofuranol methylcarbamate was investigated by measuring plasma concentrations 4, 30, and 240 min after iv 80-120 or 620-640 micrograms/kg and oral 540-700 or 2030-2190 micrograms/kg dosages of carbonyl-14Ccarbosulfan. Peak plasma concentrations were measured at 4 and 30 min after iv and oral exposure, respectively. Carbosulfan was rapidly activated to carbofuran. Reduction in AChE activity was better correlated r = 0.97 with plasma concentration of carbosulfan  carbofuran and plasma carbofuran r = 0.96 than with plasma carbosulfan r = 0.73. Signs generally occurred when AChE activity was less than 65 of pretreatment levels, corresponding to 40 pmol/ml carbosulfan  carbofuran in plasma. Based on regression analysis and metabolic studies, both carbosulfan and carbofuran contributed to the observed AChE inhibition however, carbofuran, a more potent in vitro inhibitor and the usual predominant inhibitor in plasma, was responsible for most of the erythrocyte AChE inhibition."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Lycopene is one of the major carotenoids and is found almost exclusively in tomatoes and tomato products. This study was performed to evaluate the effect of lycopene on methanol-induced liver injury and to compare the results with those after fomepizole, which is used in treatment of methanol intoxication. Experiments were carried out with 30 female Wistar rats weighting 180-200 g. Rats were injected with a intraperitoneally dose of 3 g/kg methanol as a 50 solution in isotonic saline once for intoxication. Rats were pretreated with fomepizole 50 mg/kg and/or lycopene 10 mg/kg before methanol. After 24 hours all the drug-treated and intoxicated rats were sacrificed under anesthesia. Malondialdehyde MDA levels were determined in order to assess lipid peroxidation, and caspase-3 activity was determined by immunostaining of liver tissues to evaluate apoptosis. Methanol administration significantly increased the MDA level and caspase-3 activity in liver. Pretreatment with lycopene and/or fomepizole decreased the MDA levels significantly. Similarly, lycopene and fomepizole decreased methanol-induced caspase-3 activity. The findings of the present study demonstrate that methanol intoxication causes hepatic toxicity in rats and that this is likely a result of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis induction. Lycopene has protective effects against methanol-induced hepatic injury similar to fomepizole. It was demonstrated for the first time that both lycopene and fomepizole prevent methanol-induced hepatic injury by reducing the increase of lipid oxidation and caspase-3 activation."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"Our earlier study demonstrated, that antidepressant-like and also cognitive action of MTEP, a metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 mGluR5 antagonist, was influenced by cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 inhibition in mice. We detected a decrease in the mGluR7 protein level in the hippocampus HC of mice co-treated chronically with MTEP and NS398 a COX-2 inhibitor. We found both antidepressant-like effects and cognitive to be associated with mGlu7 receptor-mediated mechanisms."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",L-type calcium channel blockade,"This study tested whether mibefradil exerts a stronger inhibitory effect than verapamil on sympathetic neurotransmitter release provoked by electrical field stimulation. Tail arteries diameter 620/-9 microm were obtained from male Wistar rats. Ring segments of 2 mm length were mounted in an isometric wire myograph. After an appropriate period of equilibration and a priming procedure the vessels were either subjected to electrical field stimulation EFS frequency 0.25-4 Hz for 30 s or a concentration-response curve was generated with either noradrenaline concentration range 0.03-3 microM or ATP concentration 0.3 mM which served as baseline parameters. EFS-induced contractions were stable and reproducible and were blocked by tetrodotoxin 1 microM, guanethidine 3 microM, and the combination of suramin 0.5 mM and prazosin 3 microM. EFS-induced contractions 1 Hz were almost completely inhibited by 10 microM mibefradil 97 but only partly by 10 microM verapamil 73. Log IC50 values were -5.6 for mibefradil and -6.6 for verapamil. Calcium antagonists were equipotent in inhibiting noradrenaline maximum inhibition by mibefradil and verapamil by 70 and 75, respectively log IC50 -6.5 and -6.7, respectively and ATP-mediated contractions maximum inhibition by mibefradil and verapamil by 92 and 97, respectively log IC50 -6.5 and -7.0, respectively. Consequently mibefradil displays an additional effect on contractions provoked by EFS-induced sympathetic noradrenaline release which cannot be explained by L-type calcium channel blockade. Probably this effect of mibefradil is mediated by the blockade of prejunctional N-type calcium channels, thereby inhibiting sympathetic noradrenaline release. Since activation of the sympathetic nervous system in hypertension is both common and undesirable, a calcium antagonist displaying both L- and N-type calcium channel blocking activities, would have major advantages over calcium antagonists lacking N-type calcium channel blocking activities."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Cell death is an early and common event in the pathogenesis associated with the abnormal development induced by a variety of teratogens. Previously, we showed that the cell death induced in day 9 mouse embryos by three teratogens, hyperthermia HS, 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide 4-CP, and sodium arsenite As, is apoptotic in nature involving the activation of caspase-3, cleavage of polyADP-ribose polymerase PARP, and DNA fragmentation. We now show that HS, 4-CP, and staurosporine ST induce the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria with kinetics suggesting a causal relationship with the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-2. This causal relationship is supported by data showing that procaspase-3 and -2 can be activated in vitro by the addition of cytochrome c to a S-100 fraction prepared from control day 9 embryos. Together, these data support the notion that these three teratogens induce changes in embryonic mitochondria resulting in the release of cytochrome c and the subsequent activation of caspase-9, the upstream activator of caspase-3. Previously, we also showed that cells within the day 9 mouse embryo are differentially sensitive/resistant to the cell death-inducing potential of HS, 4-CP, and As. The most dramatic example of this differential sensitivity is the complete resistance of heart cells, characterized by the lack of caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, and DNA fragmentation. We now show that this block in the terminal phase of the apoptotic pathway in heart cells is associated with a lack of teratogen-induced release of cytochrome c. Together, our data indicate that mitochondria play a pivotal role in cell death during the early phases of teratogenesis."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",EGFR signaling pathway,"Regulation of epidermal growth factor EGF receptor EGFR signaling is critical for the replication of human cytomegalovirus HCMV as well as latency and reactivation in CD34 hematopoietic progenitor cells. HCMV microRNAs miRNAs provide a means to modulate the signaling activated by EGF through targeting components of the EGFR signaling pathways. Here, we demonstrate that HCMV miR-US5-2 directly downregulates the critical EGFR adaptor protein GAB1 that mediates activation and sustained signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase PI3K and MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK pathways and cellular proliferation in response to EGF. Expression of HCMV UL138 is regulated by the transcription factor early growth response gene 1 EGR1 downstream of EGFR-induced MEK/ERK signaling. We show that by targeting GAB1 and attenuating MEK/ERK signaling, miR-US5-2 indirectly regulates EGR1 and UL138 expression, which implicates the miRNA in critical regulation of HCMV latency.IMPORTANCE Human cytomegalovirus HCMV causes significant disease in immunocompromised individuals, including transplant patients. HCMV establishes latency in hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. The mechanisms governing latency and reactivation of viral replication are complex and not fully understood. HCMV-encoded miRNAs are small regulatory RNAs that reduce protein expression. In this study, we found that the HCMV miRNA miR-US5-2 targets the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR adaptor protein GAB1 which directly affects downstream cellular signaling pathways activated by EGF. Consequently, miR-US5-2 blocks the EGF-mediated proliferation of human fibroblasts. Early growth response gene 1 EGR1 is a transcription factor activated by EGFR signaling that regulates expression of HCMV UL138. We show that miR-US5-2 regulates UL138 expression through GAB1-mediated downregulation of the signaling pathways that lead to EGR1 expression. These data suggest that miR-US5-2, through downregulation of GAB1, could play a critical role during reactivation from latency by reducing proliferation and UL138 expression."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Earlier reports suggested that galantamine, a drug approved to treat mild-to-moderate Alzheimers disease AD, and other centrally acting reversible acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibitors can serve as adjunct pretreatments against poisoning by organophosphorus compounds, including the nerve agent soman. The present study was designed to determine whether pretreatment with a clinically relevant oral dose of galantamine HBr mitigates the acute toxicity of 4.0LD50 soman 15.08 g/kg in Macaca fascicularis posttreated intramuscularly with the conventional antidotes atropine 0.4 mg/kg, 2-pyridine aldoxime methyl chloride 30 mg/kg, and midazolam 0.32 mg/kg. The pharmacokinetic profile and maximal degree of blood AChE inhibition 25-40 revealed that the oral doses of 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg galantamine HBr in these nonhuman primates NHPs translate to human-equivalent doses that are within the range used for AD treatment. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that 100 of NHPs pretreated with either dose of galantamine, challenged with soman, and posttreated with conventional antidotes survived 24 hours. By contrast, given the same posttreatments, 0 and 40 of the NHPs pretreated, respectively, with vehicle and pyridostigmine bromide 1.2 mg/kg, oral, a peripherally acting reversible AChE inhibitor approved as pretreatment for military personnel at risk of exposure to soman, survived 24 hours after the challenge. In addition, soman caused extensive neurodegeneration in the hippocampi of saline- or pyridostigmine-pretreated NHPs, but not in the hippocampi of galantamine-pretreated animals. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the effectiveness of clinically relevant oral doses of galantamine to prevent the acute toxicity of supralethal doses of soman in NHPs. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This is the first study to demonstrate that a clinically relevant oral dose of galantamine effectively prevents lethality and neuropathology induced by a supralethal dose of the nerve agent soman in Cynomolgus monkeys posttreated with conventional antidotes. These findings are of major significance for the continued development of galantamine as an adjunct pretreatment against nerve agent poisoning."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",estrogen receptor activity,"The ovariectomized immature rat was used as a model for analysis of action of progesterone as a modulator of receptor-mediated functional responsiveness in the anterior pituitary and hypothalamus. In response to estrogen exposure, cytosolic progesterone receptors appear rapidly, rise in concentration to a peak at 12 h, then fall to a plateau level well above control, which is maintained for at least an additional 20 h. Progesterone administration at the peak 12-h interval induces maximal nuclear accumulation of its own receptor within 1-2 h, with apparent extensive processing occurring thereafter. To this point, no differences were seen between anterior pituitary and hypothalamic responses. If animals were administered progesterone 0.8 mg/kg BW at the 12-h peak interval, subsequent nuclear accumulation of anterior pituitary estrogen receptor by an injection of estradiol was suppressed if, and only if, the interval between progesterone and estradiol injection did not exceed 2 h at no time interval did progesterone have an effect in the hypothalamus. In both tissues, estradiol readministration at 12 h after an initial injection stimulates a second wave of progesterone receptor activity, again peaking 12 h later. A single injection of progesterone 1 h before the second estradiol administration blocks the second peak of progesterone receptor in the anterior pituitary, but not in the hypothalamus. If the interval between the progesterone and second estradiol injections is extended to 4 h, the second progesterone receptor peak appears as though no progesterone had been introduced. The results indicate a critical temporal reliance of the inhibitory effects of progesterone on estrogen receptor activity and estrogen function in a well defined animal model. The effect is progesterone receptor-mediated and is manifested in the anterior pituitary, but not in the hypothalamus, even though the kinetics of estrogen-induced progesterone receptor activity are indistinguishable between the two tissues."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Despite the relevant therapeutic progresses obtained with imatinib, clinical resistance to this drug has emerged and reemerged after cytogenetic remission in a group of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia CML. Therefore, novel treatment strategies are needed. In this study, we evaluated the anti-CML activity and mechanisms of action of LQB-118, a pterocarpanquinone structurally related to lapachol 2-hydroxy-3-3-methyl-2-butenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone. LQB-118 treatment resulted in an important reduction of cell viability in cell lines derived from CML, both the vincristine-sensitive K562 cell line, and the resistant K562-Lucena a cell line overexpressing P-glycoprotein. In agreement with these results, the induction of caspase-3 activation by this compound indicated that a significant rate of apoptosis was taking place. In these cell lines, apoptosis induced by LQB-118 was accompanied by a reduction of P-glycoprotein, survivin, and XIAP expression. Moreover, this effect was not restricted to cell lines as LQB-118 produced significant apoptosis rate in cells from CML patients exhibiting multifactorial drug resistance phenotype such as P-glycoprotein, MRP1 and p53 overexpression. The data suggest that LQB-118 has a potent anti-CML activity that can overcome multifactorial drug resistance mechanisms, making this compound a promising new anti-CML agent."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in human colorectal cancer cells in vitro. It remains unclear whether individual NSAIDs act by cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 inhibition and how NSAIDs exert their anti-proliferative effects. We investigated the effects of NS-398 a selective COX-2 inhibitor, indomethacin a non-selective COX inhibitor and aspirin on four human colorectal cancer cell lines HT29.Fu, HCA-7, SW480 and HCT116. NS-398 completely inhibited proliferation, induced G1 arrest and promoted apoptosis in COX-2-expressing cells HT29.Fu and HCA-7. However, indomethacin had similar effects on all cells, regardless of COX-2 expression. NS-398 also had anti-proliferative activity on COX-2-negative cell lines SW480 and HCT116. Aspirin inhibited proliferation of all cell lines but did not induce apoptosis. Indomethacin decreased beta-catenin protein expression in all cells unlike NS-398 or aspirin. NSAIDs act on human colorectal cancer cells via different mechanisms. Decreased beta-catenin protein expression may mediate the anti-proliferative effects of indomethacin."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",estrogen receptor activity,"This study examines whether the serine/threonine protein kinase, Akt, is involved in the cross-talk between epidermal growth factor EGF and insulin-related growth factor I IGF-I receptors and ER-alpha. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with either EGF or IGF-I resulted in a rapid phosphorylation of Akt and a 14- to 16-fold increase in Akt activity, respectively. Akt activation was blocked by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, but not by an inhibitor of the ribosomal protein kinase p70S6K. Stable transfection of cells with a dominant negative Akt mutant blocked the effects of EGF and IGF-I on ER-alpha expression and activity, whereas stable transfection of cells with a constitutively active Akt mutant mimicked the effects of EGF and IGF-I. In the latter cells, there was a decrease in the amount of ER-alpha protein and messenger RNA 70-80 and an increase in the amount of progesterone receptor protein, messenger RNA 4- to 9- and by 3.5- to 7-fold, respectively and pS2 3- to 5-fold. Coexpression of wild-type ER-alpha and the dominant negative Akt mutant in COS-1 cells also blocked the growth factor-stimulated activation of ER-alpha, but coexpression of the wild-type receptor with the constitutively active Akt mutant increased ER-alpha activity. Receptor activation was blocked by an antiestrogen. Studies using mutants of ER-alpha demonstrated that Akt increased estrogen receptor activity through the amino-terminal activation function-1 AF-1. Serines S104 S106, S118, and S167 appear to play a role in the activation of ER-alpha by Akt."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"A highly sensitive flow analysis method for determination of acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibitors like organophosphorous pesticides using a new chemiluminescent reaction was developed and optimized. This method is fast, sensitive, and cheap, because it requires only one enzyme and its substrate. The system incorporates a reactor with immobilized AChE on controlled pore glass CPG and a chemiluminometric detector. Variations in enzyme activity due to inhibition are measured from the changes of concentrations of thiocholine produced when the substrate acetylthiocholine chloride is pumped before and after the passage of the solution containing the pesticide through the immobilized AChE reactor. Thiocholine is determined by a new chemiluminescent reaction with luminol in the presence of potassium ferricyanide. The percentage inhibition of enzyme activity is correlated to the pesticide concentration. The inhibited enzyme is reactivated by 10 mM pyridine-2-aldoxime methiodide 2-PAM. The experimental conditions were first optimized for activity determination of the effect of pH, flow rates, and Tris concentrations. For the measurement of AChE inhibition, the appropriate concentration of the substrate is selected such that the rate of noninhibited reaction can be considered unchanged and could be used as a reference. For optimization of experimental conditions for inhibition, several parameters of the system are studied and discussed flow rate, enzyme-pesticide contact time, luminol concentration, ferricyanide concentration, 2-PAM concentration, and configuration of the FIA manifold. Paraoxon, an organophosphorous pesticide was tested. For an inhibition time of 10 min the calibration graph is linear from 0.1 to 1 ppm paraoxon with a relative standard deviation n = 5 of 4.6 at 0.5 ppm. For an inhibition time of 30 min the calibration graph is linear from 25 to 250 ppb paraoxon."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"The sc LD50s mumol/kg in rats for diisopropylfluorophosphate DFP, Tabun, Sarin, and Soman were 14.5, 1.9, 1.4, and 0.88, respectively. The relative potency was as follows DFP less than Tabun less than Sarin less than Soman 17.610.416.4. The relative potencies correlated with the in vitro acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition in terms of the IC50 by these compounds, in whole brain homogenates or the purified bovine erythrocyte AChE. There was a dose versus time for mortality relationship for all four compounds the average time for death decreased with increase in dose. However, there was no correlation between time for death and the extent of AChE inhibition. The striatal as well as other regional medulla, diencephalon, cortex, and cerebellum AChE activity was inhibited over 90 of the control, by the lethal doses of these compounds. None of the lethal or sublethal doses had any apparent effect on choline acetyltransferase CAT or GABA-transaminase activities. Glutamic acid decarboxylase activity was increased by Soman, Sarin, and Tabun at certain lethal doses but was not affected by DFP even at the lethal dose. The results indicate that a the acute toxicity of organophosphate acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is directly related to the inhibition of AChE though there is a wide difference in their potency b a substantial inhibition of AChE activity over 90 of control is necessary for lethality to ensue after an acute exposure and the margins between lethal and nonlethal doses are extremely small and c qualitative differences seem to exist among the various organophosphates in affecting noncholinergic neurotransmitter enzymes."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"OBJECTIVES New compounds with biological targets and less cytotoxicity to normal cells are necessary for cancer therapy. In this work ten synthetic chalcones derived from 2-naphtaldehyde were evaluated for their cytotoxic effect in murine acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells L-1210.   METHODS A series of ten chalcones derived from 2-naphtaldehyde and corresponding acetophenones were prepared by aldolic condensation, using methanol as solvent under basic conditions, at room temperature for 24 h. The cell viability was determined by MTT colorimeter method. The cell cycle phase analysis was carried out by flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining. The apoptosis induction was assessed by exposure to phosphatidylserine ANNEXIN V-FITC. Cytometric analysis was performed to evaluate the expression of p53, Bcl-2 and Bax protein. The caspase-3 expression was studied by immunoblotting analysis.   KEY FINDINGS A preliminary screening of a series of ten chalcones derived from 2-naphtaldehyde showed that chalcone 8, 2E-3-2-naphtyl-1-3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenyl-2-propen-1-one, had the highest cytotoxic effect IC50 of 54 microM, but not in normal human lymphocytes. To better understand the cytotoxic mechanism of chalcone 8, its effect on cell cycle and apoptosis was assessed. Our results showed that chalcone 8 caused cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and a significant increase in the proportion of cells in the subG0/G1 phase. Our results also demonstrated that chalcone 8 promoted a modification in BaxBcl-2 ratio and increased p53 expression and caspase-3 activation.   CONCLUSIONS The studied chalcone 8 has cytotoxic effect against L-1210 lymphoblastic leukaemic cells, and this effect is associated with increase of p-53 and Bax expression."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Electrical activity and sufficient supply with survival factors play a major role in the control of apoptosis in the developing cortex. Coherent high-frequency neuronal activity, which efficiently releases neurotrophins, is essential for the survival of immature neurons. We studied the influence of neuronal activity on apoptosis in the developing cortex. Dissociated cultures of the newborn mouse cerebral cortex were grown on multielectrode arrays to determine the activity patterns that promote neuronal survival. Cultures were transfected with a plasmid coding for a caspase-3-sensitive fluorescent protein allowing real-time analysis of caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in individual neurons. Elevated extracellular potassium concentrations 5 and 8 mM, application of 4-aminopyridine or the -aminobutyric acid-A receptor antagonist Gabazine induced a shift in the frequency distribution of activity toward high-frequency bursts. Under these conditions, a reduction or delay in caspase-3 activation and an overall increase in neuronal survival could be observed. This effect was dependent on the activity of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, as blockade of this enzyme abolished the survival-promoting effect of high extracellular potassium concentrations. Our data indicate that increased network activity can prevent apoptosis in developing cortical neurons."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Nitric oxide NO is a widely recognized mediator of physiological and pathophysiological signal transmission. Its generation through L-arginine metabolism is relevant in the mesangium of the kidney where NO is produced by constitutive and inducible NO-synthase isoenzymes. Signaling is achieved through target interactions via redox and additive chemistry. In mesangial cells MC, the outcome of these modifications promote on one side activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase while on the other side cytotoxicity is elicited. These contrasting situations are characterized by 1 cGMP formation and signal propagation towards myosin light chain kinase, the effector system that regulates F-actin assembly, thereby affecting reversible relaxation/contraction of mesangial cells and 2 initiation of morphological and biochemical alterations that are reminiscent of apoptosis such as chromatin condensation, p53 or Bax accumulation as well as caspase-3 activation. Off note, NO formation with concomitant initiation of apoptosis is efficiently antagonized by the simultaneous presence of superoxide O2-. We will recall the consequences that stem from a diffusion controlled NO/O2- interaction thereby redirecting the apoptotic initiating activity of either NO or O2- towards protection. The crosstalk between cell destructive and protective signaling pathways, their activation or inhibition under the modulatory influence of NO will be discussed. Here we give examples of how NO elicits physiological and pathophysiological signal transmission in rat MC."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Apoptosis is a highly regulated process of programmed cell death essential for normal physiology. Dysregulation of apoptosis contributes to the development and progression of various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and chronic heart failure. Quantitative noninvasive imaging of apoptosis in preclinical models would allow for dynamic longitudinal screening of compounds and facilitates a more rapid determination of therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we report the in vivo characterization of Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin, a modified firefly luciferase substrate that in apoptotic cells is cleaved by caspase-3 to liberate aminoluciferin, which can be consumed by luciferase to generate a luminescent signal. In two oncology models, namely SKOV3-luc and MDA-MB-231-luc-LN, at 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment with docetaxel, animals were injected with Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin and bioluminescent images were acquired. Significantly more light was detected at 24 Plt0.05, 48 Plt0.01, and 72 h Plt0.01 in the docetaxel-treated group compared with the vehicle-treated group, with caspase-3 activation at these time points confirmed using immunohistochemistry. Importantly, whereas significant differences between groups were detected as early as 24 h after treatment by molecular imaging, caliper measurements were unable to detect a difference for 4-5 additional days. Taken together, these data show that in vivo imaging of apoptosis using Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin could provide a sensitive and rapid method for early detection of drug efficacy, which could potentially be used by numerous therapeutic programs."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Oxidative stress is known to contribute to the progression of apoptosis. Staurosporine is a broad-spectrum inducer of apoptosis, but its mechanism of action is not well understood. The goal of the present work was to elucidate the role of glutathione and reactive oxygen species ROS in the execution of staurosporine-induced apoptosis. HeLa cells were treated with staurosporine at 1 M for up to 4 h. The concentration of glutathione, generation of ROS, and activation of caspase-3 were measured. The introduction of staurosporine significantly decreased the concentration of cellular glutathione and increased the presence of ROS after 3 h. These findings were concurrent with the activation of caspase-3. Interestingly, pre-treatment of cells with N-acetylcysteine, a precursor of glutathione, and a thiol antioxidant failed to block the depletion of glutathione, generation of ROS, and activation of caspase-3. Collectively, these results suggest that the cellular redox status may be one of the critical factors of the apoptotic pathway leading to caspase-3 activation by staurosporine."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Melatonin, a safe endogenous hormone and a natural supplement, has recently been recognized to have antiproliferative effects and the ability to sensitize cells to other anticancer therapies. Phenylarsine oxide PAO has anticancer potential but it is considered as a toxic agent. In this study we combined melatonin to reduce the toxicity while securing the anti-cancer effects of PAO. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay, whereas cytotoxic assays were performed using an LDH cytotoxicity assay kit. Cell cycle analysis, Annexin V/PI staining, the mitochondrial membrane potential MMP, mitochondrial calcium and reactive oxygen species ROS generation were analyzed using flow cytometry. Sytox stained cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy and the expression of proteins was detected by western blotting. Melatonin increased the anticancer potential of PAO by decreasing the cell viability and increasing LDH release in various cancer cells. The mode of cell death was determined to be typical apoptosis, as evidenced by Annexin V/PI-stained cells, PARP cleavage, and caspase-3 activation, and with significant modulations in the expression of proapoptotic, antiapoptotic and cell cycle-related proteins. ROS generation played a critical role in induction of cell death by this combined treatment, which is validated by reversal of cytotoxicity upon cotreatment with NAC. Furthermore, the activation of MAPKs, especially JNK, contributed to the induction of cell death, accompanied by endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy, affirmed by the abrogation of cytotoxicity after JNK-IN-8 and TUDCA application. Melatonin showed promising potential as a chemotherapeutic agent in combination with PAO to achieve a better anticancer response."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Osteosarcoma is a highly invasive primary malignant bone tumor. PI3K/mTOR pathway plays a key role in tumor progression, and inhibition of PI3K/mTOR pathway represents a novel strategy in therapy of osteosarcoma. CCT128930 and VS5584 are both inhibitors of PI3K/mTOR, but the anticancer mechanism of CCT128930 or/and VS5584 against human osteosarcoma cells remains unclear. Herein, U2OS and MG63 human osteosarcoma cells were cultured, and the anticancer effects of CCT128930 alone and the combined effect of CCT128930 and VS5584 against human osteosarcoma cells were explored. The results showed that CCT128930 as PI3K/mTOR inhibitor effectively inhibited p-p70 and p-AKT expression and dose-dependently inhibited U2OS cells and MG63 human osteosarcoma cells growth. Further studies found that CCT128930 triggered significant G-1 phase arrest and apoptosis, as convinced by the dysfunction of p27, Cyclin B1, Cyclin D1 and Cdc2, and PARP cleavage and caspase-3 activation. Moreover, CCT128930 treatment obviously enhanced VS5584-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in human osteosarcoma cells, followed by enhanced PARP cleavage and caspase-3 activation. Taken together, CCT128930 alone or combined treatment with CCT128930 and VS5584 both effectively inhibited human osteosarcoma cells growth by induction of G1-phase arrest and apoptosis through regulating PI3K/mTOR and MAPKs pathways."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Cytochrome c released from mitochondria has been proposed to be an essential component of an apoptotic pathway responsive to DNA damage and other forms of cell stress. Murine embryos devoid of cytochrome c die in utero by midgestation, but cell lines established from early cytochrome c null embryos are viable under conditions that compensate for defective oxidative phosphorylation. As compared to cell lines established from wild-type embryos, cells lacking cytochrome c show reduced caspase-3 activation and are resistant to the proapoptotic effects of UV irradiation, serum withdrawal, or staurosporine. In contrast, cells lacking cytochrome c demonstrate increased sensitivity to cell death signals triggered by TNFalpha. These results define the role of cytochrome c in different apoptotic signaling cascades."

"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Exposure to alcohol during brain development may cause a neurological syndrome called fetal alcohol syndrome, characterized by pre- and postnatal growth deficiencies, craniofacial anomalies, and evidence of CNS dysfunction. The objective of this study was to evaluate pentylenetetrazol PTZ and ethanol effects on Bax, Bcl-2 expression, which further induced activation of caspase-3, release of cytochrome-c from mitochondria, and to observe the protective effects of vitamin C vit-C against PTZ and ethanol-induced apoptotic neurodegeneration in primary-cultured neuronal cells at gestational day 17.5. Apoptotic neurodegeneration and neuroprotective effect of vit-C were measured by using 3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay, Western blot analysis, which further conformed by the measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential using JC-1 detection kit and immunofluorescence analysis. The results showed that PTZ and ethanol produced extensive Bax-dependent caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation and caused neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, the cotreatment of vit-C along with ethanol and PTZ showed significantly decreased expression of Bax, caspase-9, caspase-3, cytochrome-c, and significantly increased expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein when compared with control group. Our findings indicate that PTZ and ethanol activate an intrinsic apoptotic death program in neurons that is likely to contribute to the neuropathologic effects in fetal alcohol exposure, and vit-C can prevent some of the deleterious effects of PTZ and ethanol on the developing brain. The available experimental evidence and the safety of vit-C in pregnancy suggest the experimental use of ascorbic acid as a new and effective protective agent ethanol and PTZ-induced apoptotic neurodegeneration."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",EGFR signaling pathway,"Indoline derivatives functions as an inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR with the anticancer potential against various cancers. We aim to investigate anti-breast cancer effects and mechanism of action of novel indoline derivatives. Molecular docking of seven indoline derivates with EGFR revealed, N-2-hydroxy-5-nitrophenyl 4-methylphenyl methyl indoline HNPMI as the top lead compound. RT-PCR analysis showed the downregulation of PI3K/S6K1 genes in breast cancer cells through the activation of EGFR with HNPMI. This compound found to have higher cytotoxicity than Cyclophosphamide, with the IC50 of 64.10 M in MCF-7 and 119.99 M in SkBr3 cells. HNPMI significantly reduced the cell proliferation of MCF-7 and SkBr3 cells, without affecting non-cancerous cells, H9C2. Induction of apoptosis was analyzed by Caspase-3 and -9, DNA fragmentation, AO/EtBr staining and flow cytometry assays. A fold change of 0.218- and 0.098- for caspase-3 and 0.478- and 0.269- for caspase-9 in MCF7 and SkBr3 cells was observed, respectively. Caspase mediated apoptosis caused DNA fragmentation in breast cancer cells upon HNPMI treatment. The structural elucidation of HNPMI by QSAR model and ADME-Tox suggests, a bi-molecular interaction of HNPMI-EGFR which is related to antiproliferative and apoptotic activity. The data concludes that, HNPMI-induced the apoptosis via EGFR signaling pathway in breast cancer cells. Thus, HNPMI might serve as a scaffold for developing a potential anti-breast cancer therapeutic agent."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"The effects of Ajwain essential oil and its major constituents were investigated against newly fourth instar larvae of Tuta absoluta, a major pest of tomato cropping in Iran and other parts of the world. The study included individual efficacy of each compound and determination of their synergistic or antagonistic efficacy. We also determined the activities of detoxifying enzymes in treated insects. According to the results, the Ajwain essential oil and thymol showed the highest toxicity against T. absoluta larvae LC50 = 6.14 and 7.72 L/mL, respectively, and LC30 = 3.05 and 3.57 L/mL, respectively. The -terpinene and p-cymene had lesser toxicity compared to other compounds. The larvicidal potency increased by binary mixtures of active constituents, such as thymol  p-cymene and thymol  -terpinene. On the other hand, -terpinene  p-cymene mixture demonstrated antagonistic effect on the larvae. The esterases and glutathione S-transferases were significantly increased in all treatments. Finally, our results revealed a significant inhibition of AChE activity in the treated larvae by all treatments except for -terpinene  p-cymene. In vitro experiments representing AChE inhibition with IC50 values were recorded 0.370, 0.457, 0.528, 1.094 and 1.323 L/mL for thymol  p-cymene, thymol  -terpinene, thymol, -terpinene and p-cymene, respectively. Thymol demonstrated significant potential as a controlling agent of T. absoluta larvae, both larvicidal, compatible with other compounds with strong AChE inhibition properties. These finding could pave the way for development of new botanicals based on EO constituents which should be completed with preparation of an efficient formulation and field trials."

"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"INTRODUCTION Acute lung injury ALI and acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS are acute onset syndromes affecting the lungs, which develop for several reasons and are characterized by hypoxemia and diffuse lung infiltration. The activity of thymoquinone TQ is known in acute lung injury. It is considered that it could be effective in ALI/ARDS treatment by ensuring possible COX-2 inhibition.   AIM By this study was to show the protective activity of TQ in lipopolysaccharide LPS induced acute lung injury.Material and methods A total of 28 BALB/c male mice were randomized to 4 groups of 7 as the Control group, TQ group 3 mg/kg, LPS group 5 mg/kg and TQ treatment group. TQ was administered intraperitoneally 1 hour before the intratracheal administration of LPS 5 mg/kg. The mice were sacrificed 6 hours after the LPS administration and the lungs were extracted for histopathological examination. All experimental procedures complied with the requirements of the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of Dokuz Eylul University.   RESULTS When all the study groups were compared, significant differences were found between the groups in terms of the degrees of neutrophil migration p = 0.042, intra-alveolar hemorrhage p = 0.004 and alveolar destruction p lt 0.0006. A significant recovery was observed in the lung histopathological changes neutrophil migration, intra-alveolar hemorrhage and alveolar destruction in the TQ treatment group.   CONCLUSIONS The results of this study showed that TQ may have a protective effect against LPS-induced acute lung injury. The possible mechanism could be considered to be cyclooxygenase 2 COX-2 inhibition."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",PPARgamma activation,"Age-related thymic involution is characterized by reduction in T cell production together with ectopic adipocyte development within the hematopoietic and thymic niches. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma PPARgamma is required for adipocyte development, glucose homeostasis and is a target for several insulin-sensitizing drugs. Our prior studies showed that age-related elevation of PPARgamma expression in thymic stromal cells is associated with thymic involution. Here, using clinically relevant pharmacological and genetic manipulations in mouse models, we provide evidence that activation of PPARgamma leads to reduction in thymopoiesis. Treatment of aged mice with antihyperglycemic PPARgamma-ligand class of thiazolidinedione drug, rosiglitazone caused robust thymic expression of classical pro-adipogenic transcripts. Rosiglitazone reduced thymic cellularity, lowered the nave T cell number and T cell receptor excision circles TRECs indicative of compromised thymopoiesis. To directly investigate whether PPARgamma activation induces thymic involution, we created transgenic mice with constitutive-active PPARgamma CA-PPARg fusion protein in cells of adipogenic lineage. Importantly, CA-PPARgamma transgene was expressed in thymus and in fibroblast-specific protein-1/S100A4 FSP1 cells, a marker of secondary mesenchymal cells. The CAPPARgamma fusion protein mimicked the liganded PPARgamma receptor and the transgenic mice displayed increased ectopic thymic adipogenesis and reduced thymopoiesis. Furthermore, the reduction in thymopoiesis in CA-PPARgamma mice was associated with higher bone marrow adiposity and lower hematopoietic stem cell progenitor pool. Consistent with lower thymic output, CAPPARgamma transgenic mice had restricted T cell receptor repertoire diversity. Collectively, our data suggest that activation of PPARgamma accelerates thymic aging and thymus-specific PPARgamma antagonist may forestall age-related decline in T cell diversity."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"Imipramine has been widely used as an antidepressant in the clinic over the years. Unfortunately, it produces a detrimental effect on memory. At the same time, COX-2 inhibitors engagement in the mechanisms of memory formation, and synapse plastic changes has been well documented. Our previous studies have demonstrated the contribution of cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 inhibition to the parameters of the mGluR5 pathway in memory formation. Because chronic administration of imipramine has been shown to affect mGluR5, the purpose of this study was to verify the hypothesis of COX-2 pathway engagement in disrupting effects of imipramine. Imipramine is currently used as a reference compound, and therefore it seems important to decipher and understand mood-related pathways, as well as cognitive changes activated during its use. This study covers the examination of spatial, and motor parameters. To this end, C57Bl/6J mice received imipramine, and NS398 a COX-2 inhibitor alone, or in combination for 7 or 14 days. We performed the modified Barnes maze MBM, modified rotarod MR tests, and electrophysiological studies. The harmful effect of imipramine on MBM learning was improved by NS398 use. The same modulatory role of the COX-2 inhibitor in procedural learning in the MR test was found. In conclusion, our data show the involvement of the COX-2 pathway in changes in the long-term memory, and procedural memory of C57Bl/6J mice after chronic imipramine treatment."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"AIM To investigate the in vivo hepatoprotective effects and mechanisms of Gentiana manshurica Kitagawa GM in acetaminophen APAP-induced liver injury in mice.   METHODS GM 200, 150 or 50 mg/kg body weight or N-acetyl-L-cysteine NAC 300 mg/kg body weight was administrated orally with a single dose 2 h prior to APAP 300 mg/kg body weight injection in mice.   RESULTS APAP treatment significantly depleted hepatic glutathione GSH, increased serum aspartate aminotransferase AST, alanine aminotransferase ALT and malonyldialdehyde MDA and 4-hydroxynonenal levels, and decreased hepatic activity of glutathione peroxidase GSH-px and superoxide dismutase SOD. However, the pretreatment of GM significantly alleviated APAP-induced oxidative stress by increasing GSH content, decreasing serum ALT, AST and MDA, and retaining the activity of GSH-px and SOD in the liver. Furthermore, GM pretreatment can inhibit caspase-3 activation and phosphorylation of c-Jun-NH2-terminal protein kinase 2 JNK1/2 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK. GM also remarkably attenuated hepatocyte apoptosis confirmed by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end-labeling method.   CONCLUSION Hepatoprotective effects of GM against APAP-induced acute toxicity are mediated either by preventing the decline of hepatic antioxidant status or its direct anti-apoptosis capacity. These results support that GM is a potent hepatoprotective agent."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"OBJECTIVE in septic mice, myocardial calpain was activated and induced caspase-3 activation, the association between calpain activation and apoptosis was explored in this experiment.   METHODS in in vivo model, adult C57 mice were injected with lipopolysaccharide LPS, 4 mg/kg, i.p. to induce sepsis. Myocardial calpain and caspase-3 activities, protein levels of calpain-1, calpain-2, calpastatin, Bcl-2 and Bid were detected by Western blot analysis and myocardial apoptosis was detected by TUNEL, myocardiac function was evaluated by Langendorff system. In in vitro model, adult rat cardiomyocytes were incubated with LPS 1 microg/ml or co-incubated with calpain inhibitor-III 10 micromol/L, calpain activity, caspase-3 activity, protein levels of Bcl-2 and Bid, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were detected.   RESULTS in septic mice, myocardial calpain and caspase-3 activity were increased up to 2.7- and 1.8-folds, respectively. Both calpain inhibitor-III and PD150606 significantly attenuated the increase of caspase-3 activity. Myocardial protein levels of calpain-1, calpain-2, calpastatin, Bcl-2 and Bid were similar between control and septic mice, and no cleavage of both Bcl-2 and Bid was found in septic mice. Calpain inhibitor-III significantly improved myocardial function in septic mice. In in vitro model, calpain and caspase-3 activities were increased after 4 h LPS treatment, co-treatment with calpain inhibitor-III prevented caspase-3 activity increase, protein Bcl-2 and Bid were similar between normal cardiomyocytes and LPS-treated cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was similar in in vivo and in vitro septic models.   CONCLUSION myocardial calpain activity is increased in LPS induced septic mice, subsequent caspase-3 activation may contribute to myocardial dysfunction in septic mice without aggravating myocardial apoptosis and Bcl-2 and Bid are not involved on calpain induced caspase-3 activation in our model."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"L-glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter, also has a role in non-neuronal tissues and modulates immune responses. Whether NMDA receptor NMDAR signalling is involved in T-cell development is unknown. In this study, we show that mouse thymocytes expressed an array of glutamate receptors, including NMDARs subunits. Sustained calcium Ca2 signals and caspase-3 activation in thymocytes were induced by interaction with antigen-pulsed dendritic cells DCs and were inhibited by NMDAR antagonists MK801 and memantine. NMDARs were transiently activated, triggered the sustained Ca2 signal and were corecruited with the PDZ-domain adaptor postsynaptic density PSD-95 to thymocyte-DC contact zones. Although T-cell receptor TCR activation was sufficient for relocalization of NMDAR and PSD-95 at the contact zone, NMDAR could be activated only in a synaptic context. In these T-DC contacts, thymocyte activation occurred in the absence of exogenous glutamate, indicating that DCs could be a physiological source of glutamate. DCs expressed glutamate, glutamate-specific vesicular glutamate transporters and were capable of fast glutamate release through a Ca2-dependent mechanism. We suggest that glutamate released by DCs could elicit focal responses through NMDAR-signalling in T cells undergoing apoptosis. Thus, synapses between T and DCs could provide a functional platform for coupling TCR activation and NMDAR signalling, which might reflect on T-cell development and modulation of the immune response."

We have reported that 3g/ml of recombinant YopJ when provided extracellularly induced apoptosis in murine peritoneal macrophages in vitro. The present investigations demonstrate the role of TLR2 in apoptotic signals induced by rYopJ protein in murine peritoneal macrophages. The role of TLR2 in rYopJ induced macrophage apoptosis was shown by neutralization experiments and its co-immunoprecipitation with downstream molecule MyD88. The observed functional consequence of TLR2 neutralization were the inhibition of caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation, change in mitochondrial membrane potential m and DNA fragmentation induced by rYopJ in macrophages. Further, rYopJ induced enhanced expression of IRAK-4, FADD, phosphorylation of IB and p38 MAP kinase in macrophages. Pharmacological inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase and neutralization of TLR2 with neutralizing antibodies significantly inhibited the rYopJ induced caspases activation and DNA fragmentation, suggesting the possible involvement of TLR2 and p38 MAP kinase in rYopJ induced macrophages apoptosis."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Massive hepatectomy MHX leads to failure of remnant livers. Excessive metabolic burden in remnant livers may cause mitochondrial dysfunction. This study investigated whether blockade of the mitochondrial permeability transition MPT with N-methyl-4-isoleucine cyclosporine NIM811 improves the outcome of MHX.   METHODS Mice were gavaged with NIM811 10 mg/kg before surgery and 5 mg/kg daily afterward and underwent sham-operation or approximately 90 partial hepatectomy.   RESULTS Serum alanine aminotransferase, necrosis, and apoptosis increased, respectively, to approximately 1200 U/L, 6.1, and 7 after MHX. NIM811 decreased peak alanine aminotransferase release, necrosis, and apoptosis by 70, 100, and 42, respectively. 5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation, proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, and the remnant liver weights were all increased significantly by NIM811 treatment, indicating improved liver regeneration. NIM811 also blunted hyperbilirubinemia by 54, increased serum albumin by 51, and improved survival from 6 to 40 after MHX. Hepatic mitochondrial depolarization, cell death, and MPT were detected by intravital confocal/multiphoton microscopy of rhodamine 123, propidium iodide, and calcein. Mitochondrial depolarization occurred in many viable hepatocytes 13 cells/high-power field, and nonviable hepatocytes increased slightly to approximately 1 cell/high-power field at 3 hr after MHX. Entry of calcein into mitochondria after MHX indicated MPT onset. Importantly, NIM811 decreased mitochondria depolarization by more than 60, blocked MPT onset, and prevented cell death. Decreases of hepatic ATP, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activation after MHX were also partially blocked by NIM811.   CONCLUSIONS NIM811 minimized liver injury and improved liver regeneration after MHX, at least in part, by preventing MPT onset and subsequent compromised energy supply and proapoptotic cytochrome c release."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"Previously we demonstrated that ANG II receptor AT1R blockade attenuates V2 receptor V2R, AQP2, and pS256-AQP2 downregulation in the postobstructed kidney and partially reverses obstruction-induced inhibition of cAMP generation and cyclooxygenase 2 COX-2 induction. Therefore, we speculated whether the effects of AT1R blockade on V2R and the vasopressin-regulated pathway are attributable to attenuated COX-2 induction. To examine this, rats were subjected to 24-h bilateral ureteral obstruction BUO followed by 48-h release and treated with the COX-2 inhibitor parecoxib or saline. Control rats were sham-operated. Parecoxib treatment significantly reduced urine output 24 h after release of BUO whereas urine osmolality and solute-free water reabsorption was comparable between saline- and parecoxib-treated BUO rats. Immunoblotting revealed a significant decrease in AQP2 and pS256-AQP2 abundance to 20 and 23 of sham levels in parecoxib-treated BUO rats compared with 40 and 55 of sham levels in saline-treated BUO rats. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the exacerbated AQP2 and pS256-AQP2 downregulation in parecoxib-treated BUO rats. Finally, parecoxib treatment had no effect on V2R downregulation and the inhibited, vasopressin-stimulated cAMP generation in inner medullary membrane fractions from the postobstructed kidney. In conclusion, COX-2 inhibition exacerbates AQP2 and pS256-AQP2 downregulation 48 h after release of 24-h BUO independently of V2R abundance and vasopressin-stimulated cAMP generation. The results indicate that COX-2 inhibition does not mimic AT1R blockade-mediated effects and that AT1R-mediated AQP2 regulation in the postobstructed kidney collecting duct is independent of COX-2 induction."

We performed a perioperative PK study of meloxicam 0.5 mg/kg, intravenously on emus of three different age groups 3 chicks 5 weeks old, 3.5 kg, 4 juveniles 26 weeks old, 18.8 kg and 6 adults 66 weeks old, 38.8 kg. A two-compartment population PK model including weight as a significant covariate on clearance and central volume of distribution V1 best fitted the data. The typical values 20 kg bird for clearance and V1 were 0.54 L/kg/h and 0.095 L/kg. Both parameters significantly decreased with increasing weight/age. Meloxicam potency and selectivity for COX-1 and COX-2 were measured in whole blood assays TxB2 production endpoint. Meloxicam was partially selective in emus IC50 COX-1COX-2 = 9.11. At the current empirical dose 0.5 mg/kg/24 hr, plasma meloxicam concentration is above IC50 of COX-2 for only 2 hr. PK/PD predicted dose required for 80 COX-2 inhibition over 24 hr were 3.4, 1.4 and 0.95 L/kg/day in chicks, juveniles and adult emus, respectively. The safety, therapeutic efficacy and practicality of modifying the daily dose or dose interval should be considered for dose recommendations in emus."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"A new method was developed for synthesis of 1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxylates 5a-p and 6 from nitrilimines 3a-p through amination and heterocyclization two-steps reactions. All of 1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxylates 5 and 6 were characterized by spectroscopy technique. Based on the SAR study of anti-inflammation activity, most of these compounds showed potential anti-inflammatory activity on NO inhibition in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells IC50 lt 7.0 M compared with Celecoxib and Indomethacin. Several potential compounds 5b-h, 5j, 5l, 5n, and 5o were subjected to in vitro cyclooxygenase COX-1/COX-2 inhibition assays. Compound 5d showed extraordinary COX-2 inhibition IC50 = 17.9 nM and the best selectivity COX-1/COX-2 = 1080. Furthermore, 5 mg/kg compound 5d exhibited better in vivo anti-inflammation and gastric protection results compared to 10 mg/kg Indomethacin. Docking experiments of 5d into COX-2 binding pocket have been evaluated. Following the bioactivities experimental data, the potential drug candidate 5d, significantly exhibited better anti-inflammatory effect than Indomethacin."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"The development of Parkinsons disease is accompanied by concurrent activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons of human patients and rodent models. The role of caspase-3, a final executioner of apoptosis, in the pathogenesis of Parkinsons disease, however, remains to be determined. Here, we show that gene disruption of caspase-3 protects mice from 1-methyle-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahmydropyridine MPTP-induced Parkinsonian syndrome, as reflected by reversal of MPTP-induced bradykinesia and decreased tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the nigra-striatum. MPTP treatment resulted in increased caspase-3 activation and apoptosis in the substantia nigra of wild-type mice at 24 h after the inception of MPTP treatment, as compared with vehicle-treated control animals. Gene disruption of caspase-3 prevented MPTP-induced apoptosis in the substantia nigra. At 7 days after MPTP treatment, tyrosine hydroxylase expression was suppressed and infiltration of activated microglia and astrocytes was markedly increased in the nigra-striatum of wild-type mice. All of these alterations following MPTP treatment were blocked by disruption of caspase-3 in mice. These results clearly indicate that caspase-3 activation is required for the development of MPTP-induced Parkinsons disease in mice. These findings suggest that activation of caspase-3-mediated apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons in the early stage may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinsons disease."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Visual evoked responses VER to counterphased gratings were recorded from area 17 of cat visual cortex prior to and following administration of diisopropylfluorophosphate DFP. The VER and acetylcholinesterase AChE activity of blood, retina, and visual cortex were reduced significantly following DFP administration. Approximately two hours after exposure to 4 mg/kg DFP, the VER began to recover and in some cats returned to base line levels. In contrast, blood, retina, and cortex AChE activity showed little, if any, tendency for recovery throughout the experiment. Since atropine sulfate provided at least partial recovery of the VER following DFP without affecting AChE inhibition, an accumulation of acetylcholine ACh probably is involved in the initial visual loss. However, recovery of the VER over time while AChE remained severely inhibited implicates mechanisms other than, or in addition to, accumulation of ACh at receptor sites."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"4-Methylumbelliferone 4-MU is a hyaluronic acid HA synthesis inhibitor with anticancer properties the mechanism of its anticancer effects is unknown. We evaluated the effects of 4-MU on prostate cancer cells. 4-MU inhibited proliferation, motility, and invasion of DU145, PC3-ML, LNCaP, C4-2B, and/or LAPC-4 cells. At IC50 for HA synthesis 0.4 mmol/L, 4-MU induced gt3-fold apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, which could be prevented by the addition of HA. 4-MU induced caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, upregulation of Fas-L, Fas, FADD and DR4, and downregulation of bcl-2, phosphorylated bad, bcl-XL, phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated IKB, phosphorylated ErbB2, and phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor. At IC50, 4-MU also caused gt90 inhibition of NF-kappaB reporter activity, which was prevented partially by the addition of HA. With the exception of caveolin-1, HA reversed the 4-MU-induced downregulation of HA receptors CD44 and RHAMM, matrix-degrading enzymes MMP-2 and MMP-9, interleukin-8, and chemokine receptors CXCR1, CXCR4, and CXCR7 at the protein and mRNA levels. Expression of myristoylated-Akt rescued 4-MU-induced apoptosis and inhibition of cell growth and interleukin-8, RHAMM, HAS2, CD44, and MMP-9 expression. Oral administration of 4-MU significantly decreased PC3-ML tumor growth gt3-fold when treatment was started either on the day of tumor cell injection or after the tumors became palpable, without organ toxicity, changes in serum chemistry, or body weight. Tumors from 4-MU-treated animals showed reduced microvessel density approximately 3-fold and HA expression but increased terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells and expression of apoptosis-related molecules. Therefore, the anticancer effects of 4-MU, an orally bioavailable and relatively nontoxic agent, are primarily mediated by inhibition of HA signaling."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",PPARgamma activation,"Chronic inflammation and fibrosis are the leading causes of chronic allograft failure. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPARgamma is a transcription factor known to have antidiabetogenic and immune effects, and PPARgamma forms obligate heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor RXR. We have reported that a retinoic acid RAR/RXR-agonist can potently influence the course of renal chronic allograft dysfunction. In this study, in a Fischer to Lewis rat renal transplantation model, administration of the PPARgamma-agonist, rosiglitazone, independent of dose 3 or 30 mg/kgBW/day, lowered serum creatinine, albuminuria, and chronic allograft damage with a chronic vascular damage score as follows 35.0 /- 5.8 controls vs. 8.1 /- 2.4 low dose-Rosi P lt 0.05 chronic tubulointerstitial damage score 13.6 /- 1.8 controls vs. 2.6 /- 0.4 low dose-Rosi P lt 0.01. The deposition of extracellular matrix proteins collagen, fibronectin, decorin was strikingly lower. The expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 was inhibited, whereas that of bone morphogenic protein-7 BMP-7 was increased. Intragraft mononuclear cells and activated fibroblast numbers were reduced by 50. In addition, the migratory and proliferative activity of these cells was significantly inhibited in vitro. PPARgamma activation diminished the number of cells expressing the proinflammatory and fibrogenic proteoglycan biglycan. In macrophages its secretion was blocked by rosiglitazone in a predominantly PPARgamma-dependent manner. The combination of PPARgamma- and RAR/RXR-agonists resulted in additive effects in the inhibition of fibrosis. In summary, PPARgamma activation was potently immunosuppressive and antifibrotic in kidney allografts, and these effects were enhanced by a RAR/RXR-agonist."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Cisplatin activates multiple signal transduction pathways involved in coordinating cellular responses to stress. Here we demonstrate a requirement for extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase ERK, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family in mediating cisplatin-induced apoptosis of human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. Cisplatin treatment resulted in dose- and time- dependent activation of ERK. That elevated ERK activity contributed to cell death by cisplatin was supported by several observations 1 PD98059 and U0126, chemical inhibitors of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, prevented apoptosis 2 pretreatment of cells with TPA, an activator of the ERK pathway, enhanced their sensitivity to cisplatin 3 suramin, a growth factor receptor antagonist that greatly suppressed ERK activation, likewise inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis and, finally, 4 HeLa cell variants selected for cisplatin resistance showed reduced activation of ERK following cisplatin treatment. Cisplatin-induced apoptosis was associated with cytochrome c release and subsequent caspase-3 activation, both of which could be prevented by treatment with the MEK inhibitors. However, the caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone protected HeLa cells against apoptosis without affecting ERK activation. Taken together, our findings suggest that ERK activation plays an active role in mediating cisplatin-induced apoptosis of HeLa cells and functions upstream of caspase activation to initiate the apoptotic signal."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Extracellular adenosine disrupted mitochondrial membrane potentials in HuH-7 cells, a Fas-deficient human hepatoma cell line, and the effect was inhibited by the adenosine transporter inhibitor dipyridamole or by overexpressing Bcl-XL. Adenosine downregulated the expression of mRNAs and proteins for Bcl-XL and inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 IAP2 to directly inhibit caspase-3, -7, and -9, but it otherwise upregulated the expression of mRNA and protein for DIABLO, an inhibitor of IAPs. Those adenosine effects were attenuated by dipyridamole. Caspase-3 and -8 were implicated in adenosine-induced HuH-7 cell death, and adenosine actually activated caspase-3 without caspase-9 activation. The caspase-3 activation was inhibited by overexpressing Bcl-XL or IAP2. Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that intracellularly transported adenosine activates caspase-3 by neutralizing caspase-3 inhibition due to IAP as a result of decreased IAP2 expression and reduced IAP activity in response to increased DIABLO expression and perhaps DIABLO release from damaged mitochondria, in addition to caspase-8 activation. This represents further insight into adenosine-induced HuH-7 cell apoptotic pathway."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"We investigated the relationship between peripheral and central cholinesterase ChE inhibition levels after chronic treatment of Alzheimers disease AD patients with metrifonate MTF. In a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in AD patients treated with a weekly 2.9 mg/kg MTF dose, we observed 17.15 /- 23.43, 66.92 /- 7.30 and 60.80 /- 12.20 inhibition n = 6 of cerebrospinal fluid CSF and red blood cell RBC acetylcholinesterase AChE and plasma butyrylcholinesterase BuChE, respectively. In another study, AD patients were treated with daily MTF to achieve RBC AChE inhibition levels of 85.90. The CSF AChE inhibition was 67.93 /- 13.69 n = 3 at 3-4 h after the last treatment and 6.62 /- 9.36 n = 2 at 8 days after dosing. The recovery half time of CSF AChE was 2.21 /- 1.22 days. These data show that CSF AChE recovers faster than the peripheral plasma and RBC enzymes. Under conditions of chronic weekly dosing with MTF, RBC AChE inhibition does not reflect CSF, and arguably, brain AChE inhibition. Our data do not support continuous central neuronal AChE inhibition as the mechanism for the long-term efficacy of metrifonate for the treatment of AD."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Rats injected with a nonlethal acute dose 100 micrograms/kg, sc of soman pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate exhibited signs of anticholinesterase toxicity beginning at 5-15 min with increasing severity and lasting for 4-6 hr. Generalized tremors and seizure activity indicated comparatively greater involvement of the central cholinergic system than peripheral neuromuscular effects. During peak toxicity, all the brain regions tested showed more than 95 inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE activity. The cortex area was maximally affected 99 inhibition. Among skeletal muscles, soleus AChE was most severely affected 94 and extensor digitorum longus EDL the least 72. Inhibition of EDL AChE occurred at a much slower rate than in brain and other muscles. Significant recovery of AChE activity was seen by 48-72 hr after soman treatment in both brain and skeletal muscles. By Day 7, recovery was virtually complete in skeletal muscles but not in brain, although significant recovery had occurred by this time. Muscle fiber necrosis developed within 6 hr in the soleus and diaphragm, while no necrotic fibers were found in the EDL. The 16 S AChE molecular form showed the fastest recovery of the AChE isozymes in all three muscles. Full recovery was seen after 7 days in soleus and was increased to greater than control activity in diaphragm and EDL. The inhibition pattern of butyrylcholinesterase BuChE activity was similar to that described for AChE activity, but the recovery was comparatively faster. Carboxylesterase activity in plasma was decreased to less than 10 of control within 1 hr and recovered to 53 of control within 24 hr. No significant inhibition was seen in hepatic carboxylesterase activity. It can be concluded that soman-induced acute toxicity is directly related to the rate and degree of AChE inhibition. A significant amount of soman binds to non-AChE enzymes with serine sites such as BuChE and carboxylesterases."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Kinetic studies and molecular modeling of human acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition by a fluorinated acetophenone derivative, 1-3-tert-butylphenyl-2,2,2-trifluoroethanone TFK, were performed. Fast reversible inhibition of AChE by TFK is of competitive type with Ki = 5.15 nM. However, steady state of inhibition is reached slowly. Kinetic analysis showed that TFK is a slow-binding inhibitor SBI of type B with Ki = 0.53 nM. Reversible binding of TFK provides a long residence time,  = 20 min, on AChE. After binding, TFK acylates the active serine, forming an hemiketal. Then, disruption of hemiketal deacylation is slow. AChE recovers full activity in approximately 40 min. Molecular docking and MD simulations depicted the different steps. It was shown that TFK binds first to the peripheral anionic site. Then, subsequent slow induced-fit step enlarged the gorge, allowing tight adjustment into the catalytic active site. Modeling of interactions between TFK and AChE active site by QM/MM showed that the ""isomerization"" step of enzyme-inhibitor complex leads to a complex similar to substrate tetrahedral intermediate, a so-called ""transition state analog"", followed by a labile covalent intermediate. SBIs of AChE show prolonged pharmacological efficacy. Thus, this fluoroalkylketone intended for neuroimaging, could be of interest in palliative therapy of Alzheimers disease and protection of central AChE against organophosphorus compounds."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",EGFR signaling pathway,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer that majorly affects female. The present study is focused on exploring the potential anticancer activity of 2-1, 2, 3, 4-Tetrahydroquinolin-1-yl 4 methoxyphenyl methyl phenol THMPP, against human breast cancer. The mechanism of action, activation of specific signaling pathways, structural activity relationship and drug-likeness properties of THMPP remains elusive. Cell proliferation and viability assay, caspase enzyme activity, DNA fragmentation and FITC/Annexin V, AO/EtBr staining, RT-PCR, QSAR and ADME analysis were executed to understand the mode of action of the drug. The effect of THMPP on multiple breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and SkBr3, and non-tumorigenic cell line H9C2 was assessed by MTT assay. THMPP at IC50 concentration of 83.23 M and 113.94 M, induced cell death in MCF-7 and SkBr3 cells, respectively. Increased level of caspase-3 and -9, fragmentation of DNA, translocation of phosphatidylserine membrane and morphological changes in the cells confirmed the effect of THMPP in inducing the apoptosis. Gene expression analysis has shown that THMPP was able to downregulate the expression of PI3K/S6K1 genes, possibly via EGFR signaling pathway in both the cell lines, MCF-7 and SkBr3. Further, molecular docking also confirms the potential binding of THMPP with EGFR. QSAR and ADME analysis proved THMPP as an effective anti-breast cancer drug, exhibiting important pharmacological properties. Overall, the results suggest that THMPP induced cell death might be regulated by EGFR signaling pathway which augments THMPP being developed as a potential candidate for treating breast cancer."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Tabun belongs to the most toxic nerve agents. Its mechanism of action is based on acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition at the peripheral and central nervous systems. Therapeutic countermeasures comprise administration of atropine with cholinesterase reactivators able to reactivate the inhibited enzyme. Reactivation of AChE is determined mostly biochemically without specification of different brain structures. Histochemical determination allows a fine search for different structures but is performed mostly without quantitative evaluation. In rats intoxicated with tabun and treated with a combination of atropine and HI-6, obidoxime, or new oxime K048, AChE activities in different brain structures were determined using biochemical and quantitative histochemical methods. Inhibition of AChE following untreated tabun intoxication was different in the various brain structures, having the highest degree in the frontal cortex and reticular formation and lowest in the basal ganglia and substantia nigra. Treatment resulted in an increase of AChE activity detected by both methods. The highest increase was observed in the frontal cortex. This reactivation was increased in the order HI-6 lt K048 lt obidoxime however, this order was not uniform for all brain parts studied. A correlation between AChE activity detected by histochemical and biochemical methods was demonstrated. The results suggest that for the mechanism of action of the nerve agent tabun, reactivation in various parts of the brain is not of the same physiological importance. AChE activity in the pontomedullar area and frontal cortex seems to be the most important for the therapeutic effect of the reactivators. HI-6 was not a good reactivator for the treatment of tabun intoxication."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",PPARgamma activation,"In the large intestine organic cation transporter type-2 OCTN2 is recognized as a transporter of compounds such as carnitine and colony sporulation factor, promoting health of the colon intestinal epithelium. Recent reports suggest that OCTN2 expression in small intestine is under control of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha PPARalpha. However, PPARalpha contribution to colonic OCTN2 expression remains controversial. Here we examined the transcriptional regulation of colon OCTN2 gene by PPARgamma. To exclude any additional modulation of other PPAR to OCTN2 expression, we used both in vivo and in vitro PPAR-null models and specific PPAR inhibitors. The PPARgamma agonists thiazolidinediones increased both OCTN2 mRNA and protein expression in colonic epithelial cell lines independently by PPARalpha expression. The induction was blocked only by PPARgamma antagonists or by gammaORF4, a PPARgamma isoform with dominant negative activity, suggesting a PPARgamma-dependent mechanism. A conserved noncanonical PPAR-responsive element was found by computational analysis in the first intron of human OCTN2 gene and validated by EMSA assay. Promoter-reporter assays further confirmed transcriptional functionality of the putative PPAR response element, whereas selective mutation caused complete loss of responsiveness to PPARgamma activation. Finally, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of constitutively active PPARgamma mutant increased colon OCTN2 expression in PPARalpha-/- mice. Interestingly, animals overexpressing colon PPARgamma showed a significant increase in plasma carnitine, thus demonstrating the functional contribution of large intestine to systemic carnitine homeostasis. This study reveals a PPARgamma-dependent absorption machinery in colon that is likely involved in the health of colon epithelium, in the microbiota-host interactions and in the absorption of nutraceuticals and drugs."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"1. No species differences between Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma mansoni were detected when the I50 of metrifonate for the acetylcholinesterases AChE and the cholinesterases ChE of these two trematodes were determined in isolated enzyme preparations or following exposure of the intact worms to this drug in vitro.2. S. haematobium appeared to be more affected by AChE inhibition because, after administration of metrifonate to hamsters, a hepatic shift of the parasites was observed with a dose of metrifonate 150 mg 0.6 mmol per kg which produced no shift of S. mansoni, although AChE inhibition was comparable in both species.3. Administration of a possible metabolite of metrifonate, dichlorvos, to hamsters resulted in a greater inhibition of AChE and ChE activities of S. haematobium than those of S. mansoni. Furthermore, when schistosomes were incubated with dichlorvos, inhibition of AChE activity of female S. haematobium was significantly greater Plt0.005 than that of both sexes of S. mansoni and of male S. haematobium.4. The discrepancy between the lack of a significant chemotherapeutic effect of metrifonate in hamsters infected with S. haematobium and the clinical results obtained with this organophosphorus compound in human schistosomiasis haematobium is discussed, and the need to conduct similar studies in primates is pointed out."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"We analysed apoptosis, caspase-1 and -3, and trypsin-like protease activity in the nigrostriatal pathway during 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3, 6-tetrahydropyridine MPTP-induced neurotoxicity. MPTP injected 30 mg/kg, i.p., twice, 16 h apart mice were sacrificed on 1, 2 and 7 days. DNA extracted from nucleus caudatus putamen NCP and substantia nigra SN was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. Typical apoptotic-like DNA cleavage was absent in SN or NCP after this dose of MPTP. A trypsin-like protease activity was significantly decreased in SN and not in NCP. While caspase-3 activity in the whole brain was increased significantly, caspase-1 activity was unaffected. Striatal dopamine content was decreased to 75 by 7 days. The absence of typical DNA ladder when there was severe striatal dopamine depletion suggests that in vivo MPTP-mediated dopaminergic neurotoxicity may not involve apoptotic cell death, and explains why in mice MPTP-induced dopamine depletion is transient. The region-specific decrease in trypsin-like protease activity and absence of caspase-3 activation in SN signify the importance of trypsin-like protease in the regulation of apoptosis in MPTP-neurotoxicity in mice."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",PPARgamma activation,"Uncoupling proteins UCPs are mitochondrial membrane proton transporters that uncouple respiration from oxidative phosphorylation by dissipating the proton gradient across the membrane. We studied the direct effect of several peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPAR ligands on UCP-3 and UCP-2 mRNA expression in C2C12 myotubes for 24 h. In the absence of exogenous fatty acids, treatment of C2C12 cells with a selective PPARalpha activator Wy-14,643 or a non-selective PPAR activator bezafibrate did not affect the expression of UCP-3 mRNA levels, whereas UCP-2 expression was slightly increased. In contrast, troglitazone, a thiazolidinedione which selectively activates PPARgamma, strongly decreased UCP-3 and UCP-2 mRNA levels. Another thiazolidinedione, ciglitazone, had the same effect, but to a lower extent, suggesting that PPARgamma activation is involved. Further, the presence of 0.5 mM oleic acid strongly increased UCP-3 mRNA levels and troglitazone addition failed to block the effect of this fatty acid. The drop in UCP expression after thiazolidinedione treatment correlated well with a reduction in PPARalpha mRNA levels produced by this drug, linking the reduction in PPARalpha mRNA levels with the down-regulation of UCP mRNA in C2C12 myotubes after thiazolidinedione treatment."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Sepsis is the major cause of acute kidney injury AKI in severely ill patients, but only limited therapeutic options are available. During sepsis, lipopolysaccharide LPS, an endotoxin derived from bacteria, activates signaling cascades involved in inflammatory responses and tissue injury. Apamin is a component of bee venom and has been shown to exert antioxidative, antiapoptotic, and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the effect of apamin on LPS-induced AKI has not been elucidated. Here, we show that apamin treatment significantly ameliorated renal dysfunction and histological injury, especially tubular injury, in LPS-injected mice. Apamin also suppressed LPS-induced oxidative stress through modulating the expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4 and heme oxygenase-1. Moreover, tubular cell apoptosis with caspase-3 activation in LPS-injected mice was significantly attenuated by apamin. Apamin also inhibited cytokine production and immune cell accumulation, suppressed toll-like receptor 4 pathway, and downregulated vascular adhesion molecules. Taken together, these results suggest that apamin ameliorates LPS-induced renal injury through inhibiting oxidative stress, apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells, and inflammation. Apamin might be a potential therapeutic option for septic AKI."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Our aim was to assess the feasibility of transdermal delivery of donepezil and evaluate the pharmacokinetics PK, pharmacodynamics PD, and safety of donepezil patch in vitro and in vivo. Donepezil patches were applied to the skin of rabbits and humans for 7 days, then, the PK profiles were observed in a dose-dependent manner. Donepezil was continuously released from the patch for 7 days as compared to oral administration in hairless rats and rabbits. In hairless rats, peak acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition of 34.72.0 was observed within 8 h after oral administration of 4 mg/head donepezil, and lasted for less than 24 h, consistent with changes in the plasma donepezil concentration. Peak AChE inhibition by the donepezil patch was equivalent to that in the orally administered group. Donepezil was released continuously from the patch for 7 days with a linear PK in both rats and rabbits. AChE activity inhibition was dependent on donepezil plasma concentration. The data exhibited excellent PK/PD correlation. There was no dermal irritation erythema/edema in placebo or donepezil patch group during the study period in minipigs. Thus, Dong-As donepezil patch appeared to be generally safe and was well tolerated."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"AIMS Cyclooxygenase COX-2 inhibition has been reported to suppress the biosynthesis of the gastroprotective lipoxygenase metabolite 15R-epi-lipoxin A4, also termed aspirin-triggered lipoxin ATL. We tested the hypothesis that the co-administration of aspirin with either the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib or the nonselective COX inhibitor ibuprofen reduces ATL biosynthesis.   METHODS We measured the urinary excretion of ATL in 24 patients with both ischaemic heart disease and osteoarthritis, chronically treated with aspirin and co-administered celecoxib 200 mg b.i.d., ibuprofen 600 mg t.i.d., or placebo for 7 days.   RESULTS Baseline ATL was comparable in the three groups. On days 1 and 7, 4 h after co-administration of celecoxib or ibuprofen, ATL levels did not show significant variations day 1 0.24 /- 0.33, 0.26 /- 0.21 and 0.37 /- 0.22 ng mg-1 creatinine, respectively day 7 0.21 /- 0.13, 0.35 /- 0.15 and 0.23 /- 0.18 ng mg-1 creatinine, respectively.   CONCLUSIONS Neither selective nor nonselective COX-2 inhibition appreciably interferes with ATL biosynthesis, suggesting that this mediator is not involved in exacerbating gastrotoxicity by the association of aspirin with COX-2 inhibitors."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anticancer potency and mechanism of a novel difluorodiarylidenyl piperidone H-4073 and its N-hydroxypyrroline modification HO-3867 in human ovarian cancer. Studies were done using established human ovarian cancer cell lines A2870, A2780cDDP, OV-4, SKOV3, PA-1, and OVCAR3 as well as in a murine xenograft tumor A2780 model. Both compounds were comparably and significantly cytotoxic to A2780 cells. However, HO-3867 showed a preferential toxicity toward ovarian cancer cells while sparing healthy cells. HO-3867 induced G2-M cell cycle arrest in A2780 cells by modulating cell cycle regulatory molecules p53, p21, p27, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, and cyclin, and promoted apoptosis by caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation. It also caused an increase in the expression of functional Fas/CD95 and decreases in signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 STAT3 Tyr705 and JAK1 phosphorylation. There was a significant reduction in STAT3 downstream target protein levels including Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, survivin, and vascular endothelial growth factor, suggesting that HO-3867 exposure disrupted the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. In addition, HO-3867 significantly inhibited the growth of the ovarian xenografted tumors in a dosage-dependent manner without any apparent toxicity. Western blot analysis of the xenograft tumor tissues showed that HO-3867 inhibited pSTAT3 Tyr705 and Ser727 and JAK1 and increased apoptotic markers cleaved caspase-3 and poly ADP ribose polymerase. HO-3867 exhibited significant cytotoxicity toward ovarian cancer cells by inhibition of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. The study suggested that HO-3867 may be useful as a safe and effective anticancer agent for ovarian cancer therapy."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Unlike other breast cancer subtypes that may be treated with a variety of hormonal or targeted therapies, there is a need to identify new, effective targets for triple-negative breast cancer TNBC. It has recently been recognized that membrane potential is depolarized in breast cancer cells. The primary objective of the study is to explore whether hyperpolarization induced by opening potassium channels may provide a new strategy for treatment of TNBC.   METHODS Breast cancer datasets in cBioPortal for cancer genomics was used to search for ion channel gene expression. Immunoblots and immunohistochemistry were used for protein expression in culture cells and in the patient tissues. Electrophysiological patch clamp techniques were used to study properties of BK channels in culture cells. Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscope were used for cell viability and cell cycle studies. Ultrasound imaging was used to study xenograft in female NSG mice.   RESULTS In large datasets of breast cancer patients, we identified a gene, KCNMA1 encoding for a voltage- and calcium-dependent large-conductance potassium channel, called BK channel, overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer patients. Although overexpressed, 99 of channels are closed in TNBC cells. Opening BK channels hyperpolarized membrane potential, which induced cell cycle arrest in G2 phase and apoptosis via caspase-3 activation. In a TNBC cell induced xenograft model, treatment with a BK channel opener significantly slowed tumor growth without cardiac toxicity.   CONCLUSIONS Our results support the idea that hyperpolarization induced by opening BK channel in TNBC cells can become a new strategy for development of a targeted therapy in TNBC."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Norepinephrine NE is the naturally occurring adrenergic agonist that is released in response to hypotension, and it is routinely administered in clinical settings to treat moderate to severe hypotension that may occur during general anesthesia and shock states. Although NE has incontestable beneficial effects on blood pressure maintenance during hypotensive conditions, deleterious effects of NE on endothelial cell function may occur. In particular, the role of reactive oxygen species ROS and NADPH oxidase Nox on the deleterious effects of NE on endothelial cell function have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the effects of NE on ROS production in rat lung microvascular endothelial cells RLMEC and its contribution to cell death. RLMEC were treated with NE 5 ng/mL for 24 hours and ROS production was assessed by CellROX and DCFDA fluorescence. Nox activity was assessed by NADPH-stimulated ROS production in isolated membranes and phosphorylation of p47phox cell death was assessed by flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation. Caspase activation was assessed by fluorescent microscopy. Nox1, Nox2, and Nox4 mRNA expression was assessed by real-time PCR. NE increased ROS production, Nox activity, p47phox phosphorylation, Nox2 and Nox4 mRNA content, caspase-3 activation, and RLMEC death. Phentolamine, an  1-adrenoreceptor antagonist, inhibited NE-induced ROS production and Nox activity and partly inhibited cell death while -blockade had no effect. Apocynin and PEGSOD inhibited NE-induced caspase-3 activation and cell death while direct inhibition of caspase-3 abrogated NE-induced cell death. PEG-CAT inhibited NE-induced cell death but not caspase-3 activation. Collectively, these results indicate that NE induces RLMEC death via activation of Nox by -adrenergic signaling and caspase-3-dependent pathways. NE has deleterious effects on RLMECs that may be important to its long-term therapeutic use."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",EGFR signaling pathway,"BACKGROUND Nowadays, effects of fine particulate matter PM2.5 are well-documented and related to oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory response. Nevertheless, epidemiological studies show that PM2.5 exposure is correlated with an increase of pulmonary cancers and the remodeling of the airway epithelium involving the regulation of cell death processes. Here, we investigated the components of Parisian PM2.5 involved in either the induction or the inhibition of cell death quantified by different parameters of apoptosis and delineated the mechanism underlying this effect.   RESULTS In this study, we showed that low levels of Parisian PM2.5 are not cytotoxic for three different cell lines and primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells. Conversely, a 4 hour-pretreatment with PM2.5 prevent mitochondria-driven apoptosis triggered by broad spectrum inducers A23187, staurosporine and oligomycin by reducing the mitochondrial transmembrane potential loss, the subsequent ROS production, phosphatidylserine externalization, plasma membrane permeabilization and typical morphological outcomes cell size decrease, massive chromatin and nuclear condensation, formation of apoptotic bodies. The use of recombinant EGF and specific inhibitor led us to rule out the involvement of the classical EGFR signaling pathway as well as the proinflammatory cytokines secretion. Experiments performed with different compounds of PM2.5 suggest that endotoxins as well as carbon black do not participate to the antiapoptotic effect of PM2.5. Instead, the water-soluble fraction, washed particles and organic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAH could mimic this antiapoptotic activity. Finally, the activation or silencing of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor AhR showed that it is involved into the molecular mechanism of the antiapoptotic effect of PM2.5 at the mitochondrial checkpoint of apoptosis.   CONCLUSIONS The PM2.5-antiapoptotic effect in addition to the well-documented inflammatory response might explain the maintenance of a prolonged inflammation state induced after pollution exposure and might delay repair processes of injured tissues."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"PURPOSE Although chemotherapeutic protocols that include chloroethylnitrosoureas CENUs, such as 1-4-amino-2-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl methyl-3-2-chloroethyl-3-nitrosourea hydrochloride ACNU and 1, 3-bis2-chloroethyl-1-nitrosourea BCNU, have been a mainstay of treatment for glioblastomas, the clinical outcomes have been unsatisfactory. More effective chemotherapeutic protocols for these tumors will require clear delineation of more cytocidal and cytostatic chemotherapeutic drugs.   METHODS AND RESULTS In this study, we measured the cytocidal effects of ACNU, cisplatin, actinomycin D, and staurosporine, administered within their therapeutic dose ranges, in the treatment of glioblastoma cells. As assessed by WST-1 colorimetric assay, the number of viable cells decreased markedly in T98G cultures treated with actinomycin D or staurosporine, to less than 20 of the level in control cultures at 72 h, but did not decrease or even increased after 6 days of treatment with ACNU. After treatment with cisplatin for 5 days, cell viability decreased to 30 of control. As assessed by fluorescence microscopic examination of nuclear staining by Hoechst 33258 and by electron microscopy, the majority of dead cells treated with actinomycin D, staurosporine, or cisplatin had morphologic features of apoptosis. Caspase-3 activity increased more than 20-fold in cells treated with actinomycin D, staurosporine, or cisplatin but increased less than fivefold in ACNU-treated cells. In addition to caspase-3 activation, western blot analysis demonstrated cleavage of caspase-2 during the apoptotic process. These findings indicate that actinomycin D and staurosporine potently induce apoptosis, whereas ACNU exerts mainly a cytostatic rather than a cytocidal effect.   CONCLUSION Actinomycin D and staurosporine and their derivatives are potentially effective chemotherapeutic agents against glioblastoma cells at least in vitro."

Celecoxib is the pioneer sulfonamide being pyrazole derivative COX-2 inhibitors, which used to treat pain and inflammation they may also have a role in cancer prevention. In the present investigation, a series of arylidene analogues NDP-4011 to NDP-4016 were synthesized by the condensation of 4-3-methyl-5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl benzenesulfonamide I with various substituted aromatic aldehydes in ethanol using a catalytic amount of piperidine. All the synthesized compounds were well characterized by IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectrometry. The cytotoxicity of synthesized compounds was tested on the NRK-52E cell line. From which NDP-4011, NDP-4012, NDP-4013, NDP-1015 and NDP-4016 were found to have higher cytotoxicity whereas NDP-4014 showed less cytotoxicity compared to Celecoxib. The in silico pharmacokinetic parameters of compounds were evaluated to check their candidature as a drug. Molecular docking was carried out on COX-2 structures, which revealed that NDP-4011 to NDP-4016 targets allosteric binding site similar to the binding mode of the selective COX inhibitor Celecoxib. Furthermore, results of in vitro COX-2 inhibition assay supports arylidene analogues as COX-2 inhibitors."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Osteosarcoma OS is the most common type of primary bone tumor. Currently, there are limited treatment options for metastatic OS. Alpha-ketoglutarate AKG, i.e., a multifunctional intermediate of the Krebs cycle, is one of the central metabolic regulators of tumor fate and plays an important role in cancerogenesis and tumor progression. There is growing evidence suggesting that AKG may represent a novel adjuvant therapeutic opportunity in anti-cancer therapy. The present study was intended to check whether supplementation of Saos-2 and HOS osteosarcoma cell lines harboring a TP53 mutation with exogenous AKG exerted an anti-cancer effect. The results revealed that AKG inhibited the proliferation of both OS cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner. As evidenced by flow cytometry, AKG blocked cell cycle progression at the G1 stage in both cell lines, which was accompanied by a decreased level of cyclin D1 in HOS and increased expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 protein in Saos-2 cells evaluated with the ELISA method. Moreover, AKG induced apoptotic cell death and caspase-3 activation in both OS cell lines determined by cytometric analysis. Both the immunoblotting and cytometric analysis revealed that the AKG-induced apoptosis proceeded predominantly through activation of an intrinsic caspase 9-dependent apoptotic pathway and an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. The apoptotic process in the AKG-treated cells was mediated via c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase JNK activation, as the specific inhibitor of this kinase partially rescued the cells from apoptotic death. In addition, the AKG treatment led to reduced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK1/2 and significant inhibition of cell migration and invasion in vitro concomitantly with decreased production of pro-metastatic transforming growth factor  TGF- and pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF in both OS cell lines suggesting the anti-metastatic potential of this compound. In conclusion, we showed the anti-osteosarcoma potential of AKG and provided a rationale for a further study of the possible application of AKG in OS therapy."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",PPARgamma activation,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma PPARgamma activation results in an increased rate of amyloid-beta Abeta clearance from the media of diverse cells in culture, including primary neurons and glial cells. Here, we further investigate the mechanism for Abeta clearance and found that PPARgamma activation modulates a cell surface metalloprotease that can be inhibited by metalloprotease inhibitors, like EDTA and phenanthroline, and also by the peptide hormones insulin and glucagon. The metalloprotease profile of the Abeta-degrading mechanism is surprisingly similar to insulin-degrading enzyme IDE. This mechanism is maintained in hippocampal and glia primary cultures from IDE loss-of-function mice. We conclude that PPARgamma activates an IDE-like Abeta degrading activity. Our work suggests a drugable pathway that can clear Abeta peptide from the brain."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Pesticides are used extensively throughout the world in agriculture and in pest control as well as for community health purposes. Organophosphate OP pesticide self-poisoning is an important clinical problem in rural regions of the developing world that kills an estimated 200,000 people every year. Unintentional poisoning kills far fewer people but is an apparent problem in places where highly toxic OP pesticides are available. Neurologic dysfunction is the best documented health effect of pesticide exposure. High-level exposure has both acute and long-term neurologic signs and symptoms, and adverse effects have been reported in most type of pesticides, including organophosphate OP, carbamate, organochlorine, and pyrethroid insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and fumigants. Acute OP pesticide exposure can involve in wide range of both central and peripheral neurologic symptoms. Increased neurologic symptom prevalence may provide early evidence of neurologic dysfunctions, before clinically measurable signs are evident.In this study, we analyzed the cross-sectional data on neurologic signs and symptoms from 225 rural children, both males n = 132 and females n = 93 who were occupationally and paraoccupationally exposed to methyl OPs dichlorvos, fenthion, malathion, methyl parathion and ethyl OPs chlorpyrifos, diazinon, ethyl parathion as they belonged to agricultural families handling, mixing, and spraying the OP pesticides. The children completed a specially designed questionnaire Q16 on neurologic symptoms associated with pesticide exposure with their parental help. A suitable reference group consisting of rural children n = 50 never involved in pesticide handling neither outdoor nor indoor belonging to similar socioeconomic strata included in the study to compare the prevalence of various neurologic symptoms between the two groups.Among all the neurologic self-reported symptoms, headache, watering in eyes, and burning sensation in eye/face were the most important clinical manifestations attributed to OP pesticide exposure. These symptoms could probably be the consequence of chronic effects of most pesticides on the central nervous system. The muscarinic symptoms reported the maximum prevalence of salivation 18.22, whereas lacrimation was observed in 17.33 cases, followed by diarrhea in 9.33 cases. The nicotinic clinical manifestations of acute OP poisoning revealed excessive sweating in 13.78 cases and tremors in 9.3 cases followed by mydriasis in 8.4 exposed children. The characteristic cholinergic symptoms, such as insomnia, headache, muscle cramps, weakness, and anorexia were also reported by both male and female exposed children. The high frequency of neurologic symptoms observed in the study may be due to parasympathetic hyperactivity due to the accumulated ACh resulting from AChE inhibition."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Oxidative stress in the vascular wall has intimately been implicated in the apoptosis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVECs by lysophosphatidylcholine LPC. However, the major type of reactive oxygen species ROS in this apoptotic signaling pathway remains to be clarified. In this study, we report that superoxide mediate LPC-induced caspase-3 dependent apoptosis in cultured HUVECs. The stimulation of HUVECs with LPC evoked apoptosis and ROS generation, and inhibited nitric oxide NO production in a dose-dependent manner. The classical caspase-3 dependent apoptosis was determined after 16 hours treatment by Western blotting using an antibody against cleaved caspase-3. The caspase-3 activation induced by LPC was prominently inhibited by antioxidants or NO donors and enhanced by NO inhibitors. Especially, LPC-induced caspase-3 activation was inhibited by superoxide dismutase SOD and enhanced by ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, SOD inhibitor. Additionally, xanthine/xanthine oxidase mixture increased the caspase-3 activation but catalase failed to reduce this superoxide-induced caspase-3 activation. These findings indicate that the superoxide generation caused by LPC activates the caspase-3 which results in HUVECs death. This study reveals some evidences linking superoxide with caspase-3 activation and provides a new dimension to superoxide-mediated caspase-3 activation in developing the endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"In the present study, 8 flavonoids of three major flavonoid subgroups, namely flavones, flavonols and flavanones were tested for their cytotoxic and apoptogenic effects in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia MT-4 cells in vitro. Apoptotic cells were identified by DNA flow cytometric analysis. The effects of the flavonoids on the cell cycle patterns and activation of caspase-3 were also examined. Among the flavonoids tested, 7,8-benzoflavone, flavone, quercetin, chrysin, and galangine were shown to be effective apoptosis inducers. At concentrations corresponding to ED50, the flavonoids mentioned above exerted varying degrees of caspase-3 activation in MT-4 cells. The flavonoid-treated cells demonstrated different cell cycle profiles with accumulation in either G0/G1 flavone, morin or G2/M 7,8-benzoflavone, naringenin, quercetin, apigenin phase. The induction of apoptosis did not correlate with phase-specific effects of flavonoid assayed. The relationship between chemical structure and apoptogenic activity of flavonoids tested is discussed."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"Rationally designed tetrahydropyrans THPs carrying one, two, or three aryl rings and other substituents were synthesized by the allylation of beta-hydroxy ketones followed by iodocyclization. It has been observed that compounds with one aryl ring on THP are moderate inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-1 COX-1 IC50 = 0.3 microM and cyclooxygenase-2 IC50 = 0.17 microM with poor selectivity index SI = 2-3 for COX-2. The presence of two aryl rings enhanced their inhibitory activities for COX-2 IC50 = 0.9-5.5 nM. Selectivity for COX-2 over COX-1 also increased SI = 50-1900, while triaryl substituted THPs, along with high inhibition IC50 = 0.57-4.0 nM, also exhibited excellent selectivity for COX-2 over COX-1 SI = 3200-44000. Similar to the experimental results of increased COX-2 inhibition and selectivity with the increase in the size of the molecule, their docking in the active sites of COX-1 and COX-2 also showed same trend. Seven compounds from the category of di- and triaryl substituted THPs exhibited average GI50 over all the human tumor cell lines in the range 1.6-3.2 microM and showed in vitro therapeutic indices of 8-17."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",Cyclooxygenase inhibition,"The anti-amyloidogenic potential and cyclooxygenase anti-inflammatory activity of Lasianthus trichophlebus extracts were evaluated. The MeOH extract LTM and chloroform extract LTC exhibited significant cytotoxic inhibition against the neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell with an IC50 of 17.52 g/mL and 12.28 g/mL, respectively. Thioflavin T assay indicated the LTC extract inhibition 70.56 at 50 g/mL to be statistically comparable p lt 0.05 to the positive control. Cyclooxygenase inhibition against COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes gave IC50 values for the LTM extract to be 18.20 and 29.60 g/mL, respectively while, the LTC extract showed 4.11 and 2.78 g/mL, respectively. LC-MS of the LTM extract identified 22 putative compounds, which may prove to be pharmacologically relevant. This study has provided potential insights into the utilization of L. trichophlebus to develop safer plant-based agents for anti-inflammatory or neurodegenerative diseases."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Alzheimers disease AD is the most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting mainly elderly people. The reasons why AD occurs are complex and multifactorial and several biochemical targets are thought to play a key role in its progress and development. This fact has led to the development of a multitarget-directed ligand strategy as a logical approach for designing a suitable therapy. Currently, most prescribed drugs for treating AD are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors AChEI, although these inhibitors represent solely palliative treatment. This account will summarize our current therapeutic approach for the design of multitarget drugs primarily aimed at inhibiting AChE using the key features of tacrine, which was the first approved drug for AD treatment. Secondly, as calcium homeostasis is directly related to the cell death-survival equilibrium, suitable therapy might include an action that regulates calcium homeostasis by means of targeting voltage dependent calcium channels. It is, therefore, hoped that targeting calcium homeostasis will lead directly to the development of potential neuroprotective agents. Thus, 1,4-dihydropyridines, well-known voltage-dependent calcium channel VDCC ligands, will be incorporated into the new molecules as a second structural feature in order to bring about this action. As a result of this development, herein, we describe the synthetic and pharmacological profile of new 1,8-naphthyridine analogues, which are hybrids of tacrine and 1,4-dihydropyridines. Some of our molecules have shown improved inhibitory action against cholinesterases, whilst maintaining their VDCC modulating activity, and have good characteristics as neuroprotective agents. Based on kinetic analysis of the AChE inhibition experiments, it has been shown that many of the compounds bind at the peripheral anionic site PAS. Since the AChE PAS is linked to -amyloid aggregation, this would give a third biological target for further preclinical development, making these molecules highly interesting targets in the search to obtain better treatments for AD."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"Monocyte derived macrophages MDMs infiltrate sites of infection or injury and upregulate cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2, an enzyme that stimulates prostaglandin-E2 PgE2. Nanotheranostics combine therapeutic and diagnostic agents into a single nanosystem. In previous studies, we demonstrated that a nanotheranostic strategy, based on theranostic nanoemulsions NE loaded with a COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, CXB and equipped with near-infrared fluorescent NIRF reporters, can specifically target circulating monocytes and MDMs. The anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects of such cell-specific COX-2 inhibition lasted several days following Complete Freunds Adjuvant CFA or nerve injury in male mice. The overall goal of this study was to investigate the extended up to 40 days impact of MDM-targeted COX-2 inhibition and any sex-based differences in treatment response both of which remain unknown. Our study also evaluates the feasibility and efficacy of a preclinical nanotheranostic strategy for mechanistic investigation of the impact of such sex differences on clinical outcomes. Methods CFA was administered into the right hind paws of male and female mice. All mice received a single intravenous dose of NIRF labeled CXB loaded NE twelve hours prior to CFA injection. In vivo whole body NIRF imaging and mechanical hypersensitivity assays were performed sequentially and ex vivo NIRF imaging and immunohistopathology of foot pad tissues were performed at the end point of 40 days. Results Targeted COX-2 inhibition of MDMs in male and female mice successfully improved mechanical hypersensitivity after CFA injury. However, we observed distinct sex-specific differences in the intensity or longevity of the nociceptive responses. In males, a single dose of CXB-NE administered via tail vein injection produced significant improved mechanical hypersensitivity for 32 days as compared to the drug free NE DF-NE untreated control group. In females, CXB-NE produced similar, though less prominent and shorter-lived effects, lasting up to 11 days. NIRF imaging confirmed that CXB-NE can be detected up to day 40 in the CFA injected foot pad tissues of both sexes. There were distinct signal distribution trends between males and females, suggesting differences in macrophage infiltration dynamics between the sexes. This may also relate to differences in macrophage turnover rate between the sexes, a possibility that requires further investigation in this model. Conclusions For the first time, this study provides unique insight into MDM dynamics and the early as well as longer-term targeted effects and efficacy of a clinically translatable nanotheranostic agent on MDM mediated inflammation. Our data supports the potential of nanotheranostics as presented in elucidating the kinetics, dynamics and sex-based differences in the adaptive or innate immune responses to inflammatory triggers. Taken together, our study findings lead us closer to true personalized, sex-specific pain nanomedicine for a wide range of inflammatory diseases."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"N-4-hydroxyphenylretinamide 4-HPR is a synthetic apoptosis-inducing retinoid with cancer chemopreventive properties and lower toxicity than all-trans retinoic acid. BAG-1 is an antiapoptotic gene that is overexpressed in cervical and other cancers. In this study, we examined whether BAG-1 can inhibit 4-HPR-induced apoptosis in the C33A cervical carcinoma cell line. Surprisingly, although it inhibited apoptosis induced by five different apoptotic stimuli, overexpression of BAG-1 enhanced apoptosis induced by 4-HPR, producing a 2.5-fold lower IC50 of 4-HPR. The effects of BAG-1 on 4-HPR-induced apoptosis were mediated by enhancing the caspase-3 activation pathway. Deletion mutation experiments showed that the central ubiquitin homology domain of BAG-1 protein was necessary for its promotion of 4-HPR-induced apoptosis, whereas its C-terminal Hsp70/Hsc70-interacting domain was required for its inhibition of staurosporine-induced apoptosis. These in vitro results suggest that the effectiveness of 4-HPR against the development of malignancy may be due to the overexpression of BAG-1 in cancer cells."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Cytogenetic and molecular analyses have shown that the chromosome band 12q22 is recurrently deleted in male germ cell tumors GCTs, indicating the presence of a candidate tumor suppressor gene TSG in this region. To identify the TSG, we mapped the APAF1 gene, a proapoptotic mammalian homologue of ced-4, to chromosomal band 12q22, that suggested that this might be the candidate deleted gene in GCTs. We further localized the gene between the polymorphic markers D12S1671 and D12S1082 at 12q22 to determine the role of APAF1 in the pathogenesis of GCT, and we characterized its normal genomic structure and analyzed its alterations in GCTs. The APAF1 gene comprises 27 exons, with the coding region spanning 26. The region containing APAF1 was found to be deleted in GCT by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, but without evidence of coding sequence alterations. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed APAF1 gene expression at detectable levels in all GCT cell lines analyzed. An aberrant-sized APAF1 protein was seen in one cell line. This and 2 other cell lines carrying APAF1 deletions also exhibited defects in dATP-mediated caspase-3 activation. Caspase-3 activity was effectively restored by addition of recombinant caspase-9 and APAF1 proteins, and to a lesser extent by caspase-9 alone, but not by APAF1 alone. These data do not support a TSG role for APAF1, but defects in other components of the apoptotic pathway that may be related to 12q22 deletion cannot be ruled out.

"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"The effects of acute and chronic administration of diisopropylfluorophosphate DFP to rats on acetylcholinesterase AChE activity in striatum, medulla, diencephalon, cortex, and medulla and muscarinic, dopamine DA, and gamma-aminobutyric acid GABA receptor characteristics in striatum were investigated. After a single injection of acute exposure to DFP, striatal region was found to have the highest degree of AChE inhibition. After daily DFP injections chronic treatment, all brain regions had the same degree of AChE inhibition, which remained at a steady level despite the regression of the DFP-induced cholinergic overactivity. Acute administration of DFP increased the number of DA and GABA receptors without affecting the muscarinic receptor characteristics. Whereas chronic administration of DFP for either 4 or 14 days reduced the number of muscarinic sites without affecting their affinity, the DFP treatment caused increase in the number of DA and GABA receptors only after 14 days of treatment however, the increase was considerably lower than that observed after the acute treatment. The in vitro addition of DFP to striatal membranes did not affect DA, GABA, or muscarinic receptors. The results indicate an involvement of GABAergic and dopaminergic systems in the actions of DFP. It is suggested that the GABAergic and dopaminergic involvement may be a part of a compensatory inhibitory process to counteract the excessive cholinergic activity produced by DFP."

At 30 min pre-soman, guinea pigs and rats received im either pyridostigmine Py or physostigmine Ph to inhibit whole blood AChE from 10 to 70 at 1 min post-soman sc, they received im atropine 16 mg/kg/2-PAMCl 50 mg/kg and mecamylamine 0.8 mg/kg/atropine 16 mg/kg, respectively. Protective ratios PRs were computed and they ranged from 3.1 to 7.7 for guinea pigs and from 1.8 to 2.4 for rats. In guinea pigs the PRs for Py  therapy were roughly similar to those of Ph  therapy. In both species at 30 min after im injection of Py and Ph, a linear relationship was found between percentage of whole blood AChE inhibition and ln dosage of carbamate. Positive correlation p less than 0.05 was found between the degree of reversible AChE inhibition by pretreatment, coupled with therapy, and efficacy against soman lethality.

"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"We report the breast cancer stem cell CSC potency of two nickelII-3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline complexes, 1 and 3, containing the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs, naproxen and indomethacin, respectively. The nickelII complexes, 1 and 3 kill breast CSCs and bulk breast cancer cells in the micromolar range. Notably, 1 and 3 display comparable or better potency towards breast CSCs than salinomycin, an established CSC-active agent. The complexes, 1 and 3 also display significantly lower toxicity towards non-cancerous epithelial breast cells than breast CSCs or bulk breast cancer cells up to 4.6-fold. Mechanistic studies suggest that 1 and 3 downregulate cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 in breast CSCs and kill breast CSCs in a COX-2 dependent manner. Furthermore, the potency of 1 and 3 towards breast CSCs decreased upon co-treatment with necroptosis inhibitors necrostatin-1 and dabrafenib, implying that 1 and 3 induce necroptosis, an ordered form of necrosis, in breast CSCs. As apoptosis resistance is a hallmark of CSCs, compounds like 1 and 3, which potentially provide access to alternative non-apoptotic cell death pathways could hold the key to overcoming hard-to-kill CSCs. To the best of our knowledge, 1 and 3 are the first compounds to be associated to COX-2 inhibition and necroptosis induction in CSCs."

However, because the concentrations of PPARgamma ligands used in previous studies were higher than typically expected to activate PPARgamma, we clarified whether PPARgamma ligands influence monocyte function and cell viability of the human monocyte cell line THP-1. We determined tumor necrosis factor-alpha TNF-alpha release as a monocyte function and cell viability using 3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. Both troglitazone and 15-deoxy-delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 15-d-PGJ2 seemed to inhibit phorbol ester-induced TNF-alpha release from THP-1 cells. On the other hand, neither pioglitazone nor rosiglitazone inhibited phorbol ester-induced TNF-alpha release. Because the cytotoxicity of troglitazone and 15-d-PGJ2 was significantly plt0.05, Tukey-Kramer stronger than that of pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, the inhibition of TNF-alpha release seemed to parallel the lack of cell viability.

The antimetastatic effect of the named N-2-4-bromophenylamino-5-trifluoromethylphenylnicotinamide SRVIC30 compound has been previously demonstrated in murine melanoma. Herein, we aimed to evaluate its effect when topically administrated in a murine subcutaneous melanoma model. For that, mice C57BL/6 were injected subcutaneously with 2  10 B16-F10 cells. Topical treatment began when tumors became visible on animals back. Therefore, tumor volume was measured three times a week until it reaches 12 mm approximately. At this point, 40 mg oil-in-water cream Lanette without control mice n = 10 or with SRVIC30 compound SRVIC30 group n = 10 animals were spread daily over the tumor external surface using a small brush for 14 days. The treatments increased the percentage of peroxidase antioxidant enzyme and dead cells via caspase-3 activation, with a consequent deposit of collagen fibers in the tumors. In addition, the skin of treated animals showed the presence of inflammatory infiltrate. Finally, SRVIC30 did not show signs of toxicity.

To further investigate the possible molecular mechanisms of this neuroprotection, we generated an AIF knock-in mouse by introduction of a latent transgene coding for flagged AIF protein into the Rosa26 locus, followed by its conditional activation by a ubiquitously expressed Cre recombinase. Such AIF transgenic mice overexpress the pro-apoptotic splice variant of AIF AIF1 at both the mRNA 5.9 times higher and protein level 2.4 times higher, but not the brain-specific AIF splice-isoform AIF2. Excessive AIF did not have any apparent effects on the phenotype or physiological functions of the mice. However, brain injury both gray and white matter after neonatal HI was exacerbated in mice overexpressing AIF, coupled to enhanced translocation of mitochondrial AIF to the nucleus as well as enhanced caspase-3 activation in some brain regions, as indicated by immunohistochemistry. Altogether, these findings corroborate earlier studies demonstrating that AIF plays a causal role in neonatal HI brain injury."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"p75 neurotrophin receptor p75NTR belongs to the TNF-receptor superfamily and signals apoptosis in many cell settings. In human epidermis, p75NTR is mostly confined to the transit-amplifying TA sub-population of basal keratinocytes. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF or neurotrophin-4 NT-4, which signals through p75NTR, induces keratinocyte apoptosis, whereas -amyloid, a ligand for p75NTR, triggers caspase-3 activation to a greater extent in p75NTR transfected cells. Moreover, p75NTR co-immunoprecipitates with NRAGE, induces the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK and reduces nuclear factor kappa B NF-B DNA-binding activity. p75NTR also mediates pro-NGF-induced keratinocyte apoptosis through its co-receptor sortilin. Furthermore, BDNF or -amyloid cause cell death in TA, but not in keratinocyte stem cells KSCs or in p75NTR silenced TA cells. p75NTR is absent in lesional psoriatic skin and p75NTR levels are significantly lower in psoriatic than in normal TA keratinocytes. The rate of apoptosis in psoriatic TA cells is significantly lower than in normal TA cells. BDNF or -amyloid fail to induce apoptosis in psoriatic TA cells, and p75NTR retroviral infection restores BDNF- or -amyloid-induced apoptosis in psoriatic keratinocytes. These results demonstrate that p75NTR has a pro-apoptotic role in keratinocytes and is involved in the maintenance of epidermal homeostasis."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"N,N-Dimethylformamide DMF is an organic solvent extensively used in industries such as synthetic leather, fibers and films, and induces liver toxicity and carcinogenesis. Despite a series of experimental and clinical reports on DMF-induced liver failure, the mechanism of toxicity is yet unclear. This study investigated whether DMF in combination with a low dose of hepatotoxicant enhances hepatotoxicity, and if so, on what mechanistic basis. Treatment of rats with either DMF 50-500mg/kg/day, for 3 days or a single low dose of CCl4 0.2ml/kg alone caused small increases in plasma transaminases and lactate dehydrogenase activities. However, combinatorial treatment of DMF with CCl4 markedly increased blood biochemical changes. Histopathology confirmed the synergism in hepatotoxicity. Moreover, DMFCCl4 caused PARP cleavage and caspase-3 activation, but decreased the level of Bcl-xL, all of which confirmed apoptosis of hepatocytes. Consistently, DMFCCl4 treatment markedly increased lipid peroxidation. By contrast, treatment of DMF in combination with lipopolysaccharide, acetaminophen or d-galactosamine caused no enhanced hepatotoxicity. Given the link between endoplasmic reticulum ER dysfunction and cell death, ER stress response was monitored after DMF and/or CCl4 treatment. Whereas either DMF or CCl4 treatment alone marginally changed the expression levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 and 94 and phosphorylated PKR-like ER-localized eIF2alpha kinase, concomitant treatment with DMF and CCl4 synergistically induced them with increases in glucose-regulated protein 78 and C/EBP homologous protein mRNAs. Our results demonstrate that DMF treatment in combination with CCl4 synergistically increases hepatocyte death, which may be associated with the induction of severe ER stress."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Bioindicator organisms are important tools in environmental monitoring studies. Understanding this, the overall goal of the present study was to evaluate the sensitivity and viability of the native fish species Banded tetra, Astyanax aeneus Gnther, 1860, widely spread in the aquatic ecosystems of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, as a bioindicator organism. In order to do this, we performed a bioassay at sublethal concentrations using copper CuSO4 to experimentally evaluate and validate the relationship between the trace metals and oxidative stress biomarkers response catalase CAT, lipoperoxidation content LPO, detoxification glutathione S-transferase GST, metallothionein content MT and neurotoxicity AChE in muscle of A. aeneus. Results showed changes in biomarkers after 96 h Catalase activity CAT was significantly higher above 1.5 and 2 mg/L 154.35 and 172.50 increase, respectively lipid peroxidation contents TBARS, GST activity, and MT content were very similar to CAT activity at 1.5 and 2 mg/L of Cu. In terms of neurotoxicity, AChE activity was significantly inhibited at 0.1 mg/L 64 p lt 0.001 and 0.5 mg/L 44 p lt 0.001 of Cu. Based on the bioassay results, we performed a trace metal monitoring campaign in muscle of A. aeneus caught in 15 sites with different anthropogenic activities, during the summer of 2017, to establish a baseline of trace metals pollution in the state of Campeche. A. aeneus showed the highest trace metal accumulation in the following order Al gt Fe gt Mn gt Zn gt Cu gt Hg gt Cr gt Pb gt Cd gt V gt As, while sites were arrange as follows Xnoha lagoon gt Palizada River gt Candelaria River gt Ululmal gt Maravillas gt Lpez Mateos. PCA showed a cluster between biomarkers GST, CAT, TBARS, and MT and concentration of metals Cd, Cu, Fe, Zn, Hg and Cr. Conversely, AChE inhibition was not related to a specific metal, but highest inhibitions gt50 were present in those sites with intensive agricultural practices. These results determined that, based on its physiological response and trace metal bioaccumulation, Astyanax aeneus can be considered a good bioindicator for evaluating the presence of trace metals in tropical aquatic systems of the Yucatan Peninsula."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"The present study includes design and synthesis of new molecular hybrids of 2-methylthiobenzimidazole linked to various anti-inflammatory pharmacophores through 2-aminothiazole linker, to investigate the effect of such molecular variation on cyclooxygenase COX and 15-lipoxygenase 15-LOX enzymes inhibition as well as in vivo anti-inflammatory activity. The chemical structures of new hybrids were confirmed using different spectroscopic tools and elemental analyses. Benzimidazole-thiazole hybrids linked to acetyl moiety 13, phenyl thiosemicarbazone 14, 1,3-thiazolines 15a-c and 4-thiazolidinone 16 exhibited significant COX-2 inhibition IC50 = 0.045-0.075 M with significant COX-2 selectivity indices SI = 142-294. All hybrids revealed potent 15-LOX inhibitory activity IC50 = 1.67-6.56 M. Benzimidazole-thiazole hybrid 15b was the most potent dual COX-2 IC50 = 0.045 M, SI = 294 inhibitor approximate to celecoxib COX-2 IC50 = 0.045 M, SI = 327, with double inhibitory activity versus 15-LOX enzyme IC50 = 1.67 M relative to quercetin IC50 = 3.34 M. Three hybrids 14, 15b amp16 were selected for in vivo screening using carrageenan-induced paw edema method. Benzimidazole-thiazole hybrid linked to 4-thiazolidinone 16 showed the maximum edema inhibition at both 3 h and 4 h intervals as well 119 and 102 relative to indomethacin, respectively. The gastric ulcerogenic effect of benzimidazole-thiazole hybrid 16 was estimated compared with indomethacin showing superior gastrointestinal safety profile. In bases of molecular modeling all new active hybrids were subjected to docking simulation into active sites of COX-2 and 15-LOX enzymes to study the binding mode of these novel potent dual COX-2/15-LOX inhibitors."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, a non-typhoidal food-borne pathogen, causes acute enterocolitis, bacteremia, extraintestinal focal infections in humans. Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 SPI-1 and SPI-2 contribute to invading into host cellular cytosol, residing in Salmonella-containing vacuoles for intracellular survival, and inducing cellular apoptosis. This study aimed to better understand the mechanism underlying apoptosis in Salmonella-infected macrophages.   METHODS S. Typhimurium SL1344 was used to evaluate extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways in THP-1 monocyte-derived macrophages in response to Salmonella infection.   RESULTS Activated caspase-3-induced apoptosis pathways, including extrinsic caspase-8-mediated and intrinsic caspase-9-mediated pathways, in Salmonella-infected macrophages were verified. THP-1 cells with dysfunction of TLR-4 and TLR-5 and Salmonella SPI-1 and SPI-2 mutants were constructed to identify the roles of the genes associated with programmed cell death in the macrophages. Caspase-3 activation in THP-1 macrophages was induced by Salmonella through TLR-4 and TLR-5 signaling pathways. We also identified that SPI-1 structure protein PrgH and effectors SipB and SipD, but not SPI-2 structure protein SsaV, could induce apoptosis via caspase-3 activation and reduce the secretion of inflammation marker TNF- in the Salmonella-infected cells. The two effectors also reduced the translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-B into the nucleus and the expression of TNF-, and then inflammation was diminished.   CONCLUSION Non-typhoid Salmonella induced apoptosis of macrophages and thereby reduced inflammatory cytokine production through the expression of SPI-1. This mechanism in host-pathogen interaction may explain why Salmonella usually manifests as occult bacteremia with less systemic inflammatory response syndrome in the bloodstream infection of children."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"A new procedure is described for studying inhibition and reactivation of acetylcholinesterase AChE. The enzyme, electric eel AChE, is immobilized on fiberglass and the enzymatic activity is continuously monitored in an open reactor by an assay adapted from the Ellmans method. The use of immobilized AChE permits independent inhibition and reactivation of the enzyme. Side-reactions between substrate, inhibitor and reactivator are avoided. This method is used to determine the reactivating efficiency of a new series of imidazo-pyridinium oximes for the enzyme inhibited by different organophosphorous compounds. Kinetic parameters of reactivation were determined after AChE inhibition by sarin, VX and paraoxon. The more efficient reactivators have a short methylene bridge C3 to C6 between imidazolium and pyridinium rings. Against soman inhibition, the pyrimidoxime or 1-1-methyl-imidazolinium 3-4-carbaldoxime-pyridinium propane dibromide, introduced immediately after the inhibitor, gives the same result as TMB-4 37 reactivation. 1-benzyl 2-carbaldoxime pyridinium bromide was found to be more potent in reactivating tabun inhibited AChE than pyrimidoxime. Imidazo-pyridinium oximes with a long methylene bridge C8 to C10 are good reversible inhibitors of free AChE Ki less than 1 microM."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Co-delivery of H2O2-generating agent and catalyst via a nano-Fenton reactor to the tumor acidic microenvironment for amplified tumor oxidation therapy has been widely studied. However, high side effects and low efficiency remain the limitations of the design and development of this process. Herein, a new nano-Fenton reactor in which mesoporous silica is integrated with Fe3O4 and palmitoyl ascorbate Fe3O4SiO2-PA was designed, with the product exhibiting good dispersion, stability, uniformity and consistent spectral characteristics. The results show that Fe3O4mSiO2-PA successfully enters cancer cells, significantly inhibits HeLa cells and 3D tumor spheroid growth in vitro via the induction of apoptosis. Meanwhile, Fe3O4mSiO2-PA administration in vivo markedly suppresses HeLa tumor xenografts growth via the induction of apoptosis, followed by caspase-3 activation and cytochrome C release. Further investigation revealed that Fe3O4mSiO2-PA causes enhanced production of reactive oxygen species ROS, which subsequently triggers DNA damage and causes dysfunction of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways. Importantly, Fe3O4mSiO2-PA shows few side effects and good biocompatibility in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that Fe3O4mSiO2-PA inhibits HeLa cell growth in vitro and in vivo by triggering enhanced oxidative damage and regulating multiple signal pathways. Our findings validate the rational design that mesoporous silica integrated with Fe3O4 and palmitoyl ascorbate can act as a new nano-Fenton reactor for amplified tumor oxidation therapy."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 TRAF2 is an essential component of tumor necrosis factor- TNF- signaling that regulates nuclear factor-B NF-B and c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK pathways, and compelling evidence has demonstrated that TRAF2 suppresses TNF--induced cytotoxicity. On the other hand, it has been reported that oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity is potentiated by TRAF2, indicating that TRAF2 both positively and negatively regulates stress-induced cytotoxicity in a context-specific manner. However, the causal role of TRAF2 in DNA damage response DDR remains to be explored. In this study, we assessed the function of TRAF2 in DDR induced by cisplatin, a representative DNA-damaging agent, and found that TRAF2 exerts pro-apoptotic activity through p53-dependent mechanisms at least in human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080. TRAF2 deficient cells exhibit significant resistance to cell death induced by cisplatin, accompanied by the reduction of both p53 protein level and caspase-3 activation. Moreover, cisplatin-induced JNK activation was attenuated in TRAF2-deficient cells, and pharmacological inhibition of JNK signaling suppressed p53 stabilization. These results suggest that TRAF2 promotes p53-dependent apoptosis by activating the JNK signaling cascade in HT1080 cells. Thus, our data demonstrate a novel function of TRAF2 in cisplatin-induced DDR as a pro-apoptotic protein."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"The objective of this study was to assess the neuroprotective effects of a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, Mito-Q10, the coenzyme-Q analog attached to a triphenylphosphonium cation that targets the antioxidant to mitochondria, in experimental models of Parkinsons disease PD. Primary mesencephalic neuronal cells and cultured dopaminergic cells were treated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium MPP, an active metabolite of the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine MPTP, and mice were used for testing the efficacy of Mito-Q10. MPP treatment caused a dose-dependent loss of tyrosine hydroxylase and membrane potential and an increase in caspase-3 activation in dopaminergic cells, which were reversed by Mito-Q10. MPTP treatment induced a loss of striatal dopamine and its metabolites, inactivation of mitochondrial aconitase in the substantia nigra, and a loss of locomotor activity in mice. Treatment with Mito-Q10 significantly inhibited both MPP- and MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in cell culture and mouse models. Collectively, these results indicate that mitochondrial targeting of antioxidants is a promising neuroprotective strategy in this preclinical mouse model of PD."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Perampanel is a highly selective and non-competitive -amino-3-hydroxy- 5 -methyl-4-isoxazole propionate AMPA receptor AMPAR antagonist, which has been licensed as an orally administered antiepileptic drug in more than 55 countries. Recently, perampanel was found to exert neuroprotective effects in hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke models.   OBJECTIVE In this study, the protective effect of perampanel was investigated.   METHODS The protective effect of perampanel was investigated in an in vitro Traumatic Neuronal Injury TNI model in primary cultured cortical neurons.   RESULTS We found that perampanel significantly preserved morphological changes, attenuated lactate dehydrogenase LDH release and inhibited caspase-3 activation after TNI. The TNI-induced necroptosis, as evidenced by flow cytometry, was markedly reduced by perampanel treatment. The results of western blot showed that perampanel decreased the expression and phosphorylation of the necroptotic factors, receptor protein interacting kinase 1 RIPK1 and RIPK3. In addition, treatment with perampanel increased the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3 in a time-dependent manner up to 24 h after TNI. Treatment with the Akt inhibitor LY294002 partially reversed the protective effects of perampanel.   CONCLUSION Our present data suggest that necroptosis plays a key role in the pathogenesis of neuronal death after TNI, and that perampanel might have therapeutic potential for patients with Traumatic Brain Injury TBI."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"RATIONALE Bone morphogenic protein BMP4 can stimulate superoxide production and exert proinflammatory effects on the endothelium. The underlying mechanisms of how BMP4 mediates endothelial dysfunction and hypertension remain elusive.   OBJECTIVE To elucidate the cellular pathways by which BMP4-induced endothelial dysfunction is mediated through oxidative stress-dependent upregulation of cyclooxygenase COX-2.   METHODS AND RESULTS Impaired endothelium-dependent relaxations, exaggerated endothelium-dependent contractions, and reactive oxygen species ROS production were observed in BMP4-treated mouse aortae, which were prevented by the BMP4 antagonist noggin. Pharmacological inhibition with thromboxane prostanoid receptor antagonist or COX-2 but not COX-1 inhibitor prevented BMP4-induced endothelial dysfunction, which was further confirmed with the use of COX-1-/- or COX-2-/- mice. Noggin and knockdown of BMP receptor 1A abolished endothelium-dependent contractions and COX-2 upregulation in BMP4-treated aortae. Apocynin and tempol treatment were effective in restoring endothelium-dependent relaxations, preventing endothelium-dependent contractions and eliminating ROS overproduction and COX-2 overexpression in BMP4-treated aortae. BMP4 increased p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK activity through a ROS-sensitive mechanism and p38 MAPK inhibitor prevented BMP4-induced endothelial dysfunction. COX-2 inhibition blocked the effect of BMP4 without affecting BMP4-induced ROS overproduction and COX-2 upregulation. Importantly, renal arteries from hypertensive rats and humans showed higher levels of COX-2 and BMP4 accompanied by endothelial dysfunction.   CONCLUSIONS We show for the first time that ROS serve as a pathological link between BMP4 stimulation and the downstream COX-2 upregulation in endothelial cells, leading to endothelial dysfunction through ROS-dependent p38 MAPK activation. This BMP4/ROS/COX-2 cascade is important in the maintenance of endothelial dysfunction in hypertension."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",estrogen receptor activity,"The transcriptional activity of nuclear hormone receptors is known to be modulated by coregulator proteins. We found that the repressor of estrogen receptor activity REA, a protein recruited to the hormone-occupied estrogen receptor ER, decreased the transcriptional activity of ER, both when ER was acting directly through DNA response elements as well as when it was tethered to other transcription factors. Administration of antisense REA resulted in a 2-4-fold increase in ER transactivation, implying that endogenous REA normally dampens the stimulatory response to estradiol. To define the interaction regions between ER and REA, we used glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. We found that REA bound to the ligand-binding domain E domain of ER, but not to other regions of ER, and that REA interaction with ER involved a region in the C-terminal half of REA. REA and the coactivator SRC-1 were involved in a functional competition for regulation of ER transcriptional activity, which we show results from competition between these two coregulators for interaction with ER. REA contains an LXXLL motif near its N terminus, but this motif was not involved in its binding to ER. Rather, this sequence was required for the competitive binding of REA and SRC-1 to ER and thus for optimal repression of ER activity. Our findings show that the regions of REA required for its interaction with ER and for its repression of ER activity are different."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"We investigated the mechanism of mitomycin C MMC-induced apoptosis in SNU-16 human gastric adenocarcinoma cells. Caspase-8 and caspase-3 were activated in MMC-treated cells whereas caspase-1 was not activated, and cytochrome c was released from mitochondrial membrane to cytosol suggesting that caspase-9 was activated during the MMC-induced apoptotic process. Protein kinase C PKC delta was cleaved to its characteristic 40 kDa fragment in a caspase-3-dependent manner on the other hand PKC zeta was cleaved to approximately 40 kDa independently of caspase-3 in the drug-induced apoptosis of the cells. Incubation with z-DEVD-fmk and benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone z-VAD-fmk almost completely abrogated MMC-induced DNA fragmentation, indicating that activation of these caspases was crucially involved in MMC-induced apoptosis. Activation of caspase-8 in response to Fas triggering by recruitment of caspase-8 to the Fas has also been found, however, MMC did not induce FasL and Fas expression, as evidenced by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Taken together, these findings indicate that MMC-induced apoptosis in SNU-16 cells was mediated by caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 activation independently of FasL/Fas interactions."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Gadolinium Gd, a rare-earth lanthanides metal, is widely utilized for various industrial and medical purposes, particularly in brain magnetic resonance imaging. However, its potential effects on the impairment of the central nervous system remain uncertain, especially with regard to the mitochondria, the potential primary target in metal-induced neural injury. This study investigates the effects of gadolinium on mitochondrial energy metabolism, ROS accumulation, and cell death toward cortical neurons. Results show that the metabolic activity of the mitochondria significantly decreased as early as 3h after exposure of cells to gadolinium chloride. Subsequently, significant elevation of intracellular ROS, decrease in ATP synthesis, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase-3 were observed. Following these changes, increased release of LDH into culture medium and DNA fragmentation were detected. Inhibition of both cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation could significantly reduce Gd-induced neuron cell death. All these results suggest that gadolinium cause neuron cell apoptosis primarily by inhibiting mitochondrial function and inducing oxidative stress. The present work provides new insight into the toxicological mechanism of gadolinium in neurons."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Essential oils EOs are bioactive compounds with therapeutic potential for use as alternatives or as support to conventional treatments. However, EOs present limitations, such as sensibility to environmental factors, which can be overcome through microencapsulation. The objective of this study was to produce, by spray drying, chitosan microparticles CMs loaded with EO of Lemongrass Cymbopogon flexuosus, Geranium Pelargonium x ssp and Copaiba Copaifera officinalis. Physicochemical and biological characterization of these microparticles showed that CMs presented spherical morphology, had an average size range of 2-3 m with positive zeta potential ZP values, and enhanced thermal stability, compared to free EO. The encapsulation efficiency EE ranged from 4.8-58.6, depending on the oils properties. In vitro EO release from CMs was determined at different pHs, with 94 release observed in acid media. All microparticles were non-hemolytic at concentrations of up to 0.1 mgmL-1. EOs and CMs presented acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition activity IC 50 ranged from 11.92 to 28.18 gmL-1. Geranium and Copaiba EOs presented higher toxicity against Artemia salina, and greater inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, indicating potential bioactivity for Alzheimers disease AD. Our findings demonstrate that CM systems may show promise for the controlled release of these EOs."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"To evaluate the anticarcinogenic activity of methanol extract of Pleurospermum kamtschaticum PKE, we assessed its apoptosis-inducing capability in HT-29 colon carcinoma cells. PKE treatment for 2 h reduced cell viability in a dose-related manner, and induced apoptotic morphological changes. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that PKE treatment at 0.05 mg/ml induced early apoptosis in 66.2 of HT-29 cells. Additionally, Bcl-2 expression was substantially reduced in PKE-treated HT-29 cells, increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. The protein levels of procaspase-9 and procaspase-3 were decreased markedly, reflecting caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, and resulting PARP cleavage was noted in the PKE-treated HT-29 cells. Furthermore, we detected increased NAG-1 expression in the PKE-treated HT-29 cells. In an in vivo study, intraperitoneal PKE administration suppressed the formation of tumor nodules in the lungs of mice. These results indicate that PKE can serve as a beneficial supplement in the treatment and the prevention of colon cancer."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Waltheria Indica L. is traditionally used in Africa, South America and Hawaii to treat pain, anemia, diarrhea, epilepsy and inflammatory related diseases.   AIM OF THE STUDY This study aimed to identify extraction parameters to maximize tiliroside yield and to quantitative secondary metabolite composition of Waltheria Indica under various extraction conditions. The extracts were tested for COX-2 inhibition and their activity correlated with the type and quantity of the secondary metabolites. Insight was gained about how extraction parameters influence the extract composition and thus the COX-2 enzymatic inhibitory activity.   MATERIALS AND METHODS Powdered leaves of Waltheria Indica were extracted using water, methanol, ethyl acetate and ethanol at different temperatures. Tiliroside was identified by HPLC-HRMS n and quantified using a tiliroside standard. The compound groups of the secondary metabolites were quantified by spectrometric methods. Inhibitory potential of different Waltheria extracts against the COX-2 enzyme was determined using a fluorometric COX-2 inhibition assay.   RESULTS The molecule, tiliroside, exhibited a COX-2 inhibition of 10.4 starting at a concentration of 15 M and increased in a dose dependent manner up to 51.2 at 150 M. The ethanolic extract at 30 C and the ethyl acetate extract at 90 C inhibited COX-2 with 37.7 and 38.9, while the methanolic and aqueous extract showed a lower inhibition of 21.9 and 9.2 respectively. The results concerning phenol, alkaloid and tiliroside concentration in the extracts showed no dependence on COX-2 inhibition. The extracts demonstrated a direct correlation of COX-2 inhibitory activity with their triterpenoid-/steroidal-saponin concentration. COX-2 inhibition increased linearly with the concentration of the saponins.   CONCLUSION The data suggest that Waltheria Indica extracts inhibit the key inflammatory enzyme, COX-2, as a function of triterpenoid- and steroidal-saponin concentration and support the known efficacy of extracted Waltheria Indica leaves as a traditional treatment against inflammation related diseases."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Previous studies indicated that ethanol-induced neurodegeneration in postnatal day 7 P7 mice, widely used as a model for the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, was accompanied by glycogen synthase kinase-3beta GSK-3beta and caspase-3 activation. Presently, we examined whether tau, a microtubule associated protein, is modified by GSK-3beta and caspase-3 in ethanol-treated P7 mouse forebrains. We found that ethanol increased phosphorylated tau recognized by the paired helical filament PHF-1 antibody and by the antibody against tau phosphorylated at Ser199. Ethanol also generated tau fragments recognized by an antibody against caspase-cleaved tau C-tau. C-tau was localized in neurons bearing activated caspase-3 and fragmented nuclei. Over time, cell debris and degenerated projections containing C-tau appeared to be engulfed by activated microglia. A caspase-3 inhibitor partially blocked C-tau formation. Lithium, a GSK-3beta inhibitor, blocked ethanol-induced caspase-3 activation, phosphorylated tau elevation, C-tau formation, and microglial activation. These results indicate that tau is phosphorylated by GSK-3beta and cleaved by caspase-3 during ethanol-induced neurodegeneration in the developing brain."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"Prostaglandins PGs have proven important during parturition, but inhibition of PG production treating preterm labor PTL results in significant maternal and fetal side effects. We hypothesize that specific inhibition of either cyclooxygenase COX-1 or -2 may result in separation of therapeutic and toxic effects. We demonstrate that COX-2, but not COX-1, is induced during inflammation-mediated PTL caused by lipopolysaccharide LPS administration. A two- to threefold increase in uterine and ovarian PG concentrations coincides with this induction of COX-2. The COX-2-selective inhibitor SC-236 proved effective in stopping preterm delivery and the increases in PGs. The COX-1-selective inhibitor SC-560 also attenuated uterine and ovarian PG production after LPS but did not inhibit PTL as efficiently as SC-236. COX-1-deficient mice, which show delay in the onset of term labor, exhibited no delay in onset of PTL after LPS. These findings suggest that the mechanisms for initiation of inflammation-mediated PTL and term labor differ and that selective COX-2 inhibition may provide a means of stopping inflammation-induced PTL in humans."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Many current studies of Parkinsons disease PD suggest that inflammation is involved in the neurodegenerative process. PD-1, a traditional Korean medicine, used to treat various brain diseases in Korea. This study was designed to investigate the effect of PD-1 extract in the Parkinsons model of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine MPTP lesioned mice. The MPTP administration caused the dopamine neuron loss in the striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta SNpc, which was demonstrated by a depletion of tyrosine hydroxylase TH. In addition, a reduction of bcl-2 expression with elevation of bax expression, caspase-3 activation, and release of cytochrome c into cytosol in dopaminergic neurons of SNpc were noted. Oral administration of PD-1 extract 50 and 100 mg kg-1 attenuated the MPTP-induced depletion of TH proteins in the striatum and SNpc and prevented the apoptotic effects. These results indicate that PD-1 extract is able to protect dopaminergic neurons from MPTP-induced neuronal death, with important implications for the treatment of PD."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Transportations of rivastigmine containing liposomes across Caco-2 cells were studied and in vitro test results were compared with in vivo results. MTT test was used for cell viability studies. Series of formulations were prepared containing rivastigmine which is used for the treatment of Alzheimers disease. Characterization and stability studies for liposome formulations were performed. Encapsulation efficiencies of liposomes were 35.4, 25.2 and 29.9 for rivastigmine, rivastigmine-sodium taurocholate, rivastigmine-dimethyl-beta-CD liposomes, respectively. In stability studies, particle size and size distribution, zeta potential, rivastigmine amounts were determined and shelf lives of liposomes were calculated. Penetration properties of rivastigmine through Caco-2 cells, dialysis membrane and kinetics of release from liposomes were determined. Permeability coefficients were calculated after diffusion studies. The highest value of  cumulative amount of rivastigmine passed through caco-2 cell cultures was found to be 87.2 for rivastigmine-sodium taurocholate solution and 12.8 for rivastigmine-sodium taurocholate liposome. The highest permeability coefficient value was obtained with sodium taurocholate liposomes for -0.75. Rivastigmine liposomes and solutions were also applied to animals. Acetyl choline esterase AChE activity was determined by the Ellman method on mice. AChE inhibition values were calculated using blood and brain tissue samples. The physical appearances of the brains were investigated by TEM microscope. The highest value of AChE inhibition was observed for rivastigmine and sodium taurocholate liposomes. The histological investigations and observations also supported these results."

Their toxicity was also assessed in vitro. Results showed that the most prominent compound 3 could significantly decrease production of the above inflammatory factors. Docking study was performed for the representative compounds 3, UA, and Celecoxib to explain their interaction with cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 receptor active site. In vitro enzyme study implied that compound 3 exerted its anti-inflammatory activity through COX-2 inhibition."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"A novel series of triazole tethered coumarin-benzotriazole hybrids based on donepezil skeleton has been designed and synthesized as multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimers disease AD. Among the synthesized compounds 13b showed most potent acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition IC50 = 0.059  with mixed type inhibition scenario. Structure-activity relationship revealed that three-carbon alkyl chain connecting coumarin and triazole is well tolerable for inhibitory potential. Hybrids obtained from 4-hydroxycoumarin and 1-benzotriazole were most potent AChE inhibitors. The inhibitory potential of all compounds against butyrylcholinesterase was also evaluated but all showed negligible activity suggesting that the hybrid molecules are selective AChE inhibitors. 13b most potent AChE inhibitor also showed copper-induced A1-42 aggregation inhibition 34.26 at 50  and chelating properties for metal ions Cu2, Fe2, and Zn2 involved in AD pathogenesis along with DNA protective potential against degenerative actions of OH radicals. Molecular modelling studies confirm the potential of 13b in blocking both PAS and CAS of AChE. In addition, interactions of 13b with A1-42 monomer are also streamlined. Therefore, hybrid 13b can act as an effective hit lead molecule for further development of selective AChE inhibitors as multifunctional anti-Alzheimers agents."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"In connection with our continued research to generate new aza-fused heteroaromatic chemical scaffolds, we developed a highly atom-economical three-component route to novel 3,4-dihydropyrrolo1,2-apyrazine ring skeleton multi-functionalized on the pyrazine unit. This 411 annulation approach led us to gain access to a new N-fused bicyclic chemical space having two distinctive functional groups heteroaryl and aroyl in a trans manner. Investigation of anticancer activity of the synthesized compounds and their derivatives revealed that 3R,4S-3-4-bromophenyl-4-4-fluorobenzoyl-2-2-oxo-2-phenylethyl-3,4-dihydropyrrolo1,2-apyrazin-2-ium bromide 3h has potent anticancer activity. 3h significantly inhibited cell viability in prostate cancer cells PC-3 and breast cancer cells MCF-7 with IC50 value of 1.18  0.05 M and 1.95  0.04 M, respectively. In addition, 3h strongly reduced cell migration in a dose dependent manner, and induced apoptosis via caspase-3 activation and cleavage of PARP in PC-3 and MCF-7 cells. Our results in this study imply that 3h can be a potential anticancer agent against prostate cancer and breast cancer."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Recent studies have suggested that children undergoing surgery under anesthesia could be at an increased risk for the development of learning disabilities, but whether anesthetics contribute to this learning disability is unclear. Therefore, the authors set out to assess the effects of sevoflurane, the most commonly used inhalation anesthetic, on caspase activation, apoptosis, beta-amyloid protein levels, and neuroinflammation in the brain tissues of neonatal nave and Alzheimer disease AD transgenic mice.   METHODS Six-day-old nave and AD transgenic B6.Cg-Tgamyloid precursor protein swe, PSEN1dE985Dbo/J mice were treated with sevoflurane. The mice were killed at the end of the anesthesia, and the brain tissues were harvested and then subjected to Western blot, immunocytochemistry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and real-time polymerase chain reaction.   RESULTS Herein, the authors show for the first time that sevoflurane anesthesia induced caspase activation and apoptosis, altered amyloid precursor protein processing, and increased beta-amyloid protein levels in the brain tissues of neonatal mice. Furthermore, sevoflurane anesthesia led to a greater degree of neurotoxicity in the brain tissues of the AD transgenic mice when compared with nave mice and increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in the brain tissues of only the AD transgenic mice. Finally, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor antagonist 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate attenuated sevoflurane-induced caspase-3 activation and beta-amyloid protein accumulation in vivo.   CONCLUSION These results suggest that sevoflurane may induce neurotoxicity in neonatal mice. AD transgenic mice could be more vulnerable to such neurotoxicity. These findings should promote more studies to determine the potential neurotoxicity of anesthesia in animals and humans, especially in children."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"Three series of 4-aminopyridine-and 4-aminoquinoline based symmetrical bivalent acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibitors were prepared and compared to previously synthesized dimers of 9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine tacrine. In each case significant, tether length-dependent increases in AChE inhibition potency and selectivity up to 3000-fold were observed relative to the corresponding monomer, indicating dual-site binding of these inhibitors to AChE. Assay of the corresponding alkylated monomers revealed that the alkylene tether played at least two complementary roles in the dimer series. In addition to reducing the entropy loss that occurs on binding both monomeric units of the dimer, the alkylene tether can also significantly improve potency through hydrophobic effects."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",Cyclooxygenase inhibition,"We examined the roles of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways in the alterations in lung fluid and protein exchange after pulmonary microembolism. Infusion of alpha-thrombin T 55 /- 13 U/kg immediately increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure Ppa and mean pulmonary vascular resistance PVR, but both Ppa and PVR waned with time after T. Cyclooxygenase inhibition with either indomethacin or ketoprofen produced sustained increases in Ppa and PVR. The initial increases in Ppa in the cyclooxygenase-inhibited groups CI were matched to the control group by administering greater amounts of T. In the control group, T rapidly increased pulmonary lymph flow Qlym by two- to threefold, and this was associated with a steady increase in lymph-to-plasma protein concentration ratio L/P. In contrast, in cyclooxygenase-inhibited CI groups, Qlym increased gradually to greater levels than in the control group, and L/P did not change. The effect on lung vascular permeability was determined by inflating a left atrial balloon catheter to raise pulmonary capillary pressure Pc. An increase in Pc after T in the control group further increased Qlym and did not change L/P, whereas the increase in Pc after T in CI groups further increased Qlym and decreased L/P, indicating that cyclooxygenase inhibition prevented the increase in permeability. We determined whether lipoxygenase activation contributed to the increase in Qlym in CI groups by examining the effects of BW755C, an inhibitor of both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways. BW755C resulted in the same increase in Qlym after T as in the control group, but the increase in Qlym was associated with a decrease in L/P. Therefore, inhibition of both pathways prevented the permeability increase and the greater increase in Qlym. The results indicate that cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways contribute to the increases in pulmonary transvascular fluid and protein fluxes after thrombin."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"The primary pathology in Parkinsons disease patients is significant loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra through multiple mechanisms. We previously have demonstrated the involvement of nitric oxide NO in the dopaminergic neurodegeneration induced by 6-hydroxydopamine 6-OHDA and lipopolysaccharide LPS in rats. The present study was undertaken to investigate further the role of NO in the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons during the early time period after administration of 6-OHDA and LPS. Measurement of dopamine and its metabolites, TH immunolabeling, cytochrome-c release, mitochondrial complex-I and caspase-3 activity assessment was performed in both the 6-OHDA- and LPS-induced experimental models of Parkinsons disease. Significant decreases in dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid DOPAC, homovanillic acid HVA, tyrosine hydroxylase TH immunolabeling and mitochondrial complex-I activity were observed, with increase in cytochrome-c release and caspase-3 activation. Dopmaine and its metabolite levels, mitochondrial complex-I activity and caspase-3 activity were significantly reversed with treatment of the NOS inhibitor, L-NAME. The reduction in the extent of cytochrome-c release responded variably to NOS inhibition in both the models. The results obtained suggest that NO contributes to mitochondria-mediated neuronal apoptosis in the dopaminergic neurodegeneration induced by 6-OHDA and LPS in rats."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Four new compounds, paucinervins A-D 1-4, and 15 known ones were isolated from the leaves of Garcinia paucinervis. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic evidences. All of the 19 compounds were evaluated for their apoptosis-inducing effects using HeLa-C3 cells which have been genetically engineered to possess a fluorescent biosensor capable of detecting caspase-3 activation. Eight of them were found to activate caspase-3 in HeLa-C3 cells within 72 h at the concentration of 25 microM. Moreover, the values of IC50 were measured for all four new compounds on HeLa cells using the MTT assay. Among them, compound 2 paucinervin B had the lowest IC50 value of 9.5 microM, while the other three new compounds had much higher IC50 values of 29.5, 52.5, and 95.6 microM, respectively. This result shows that paucinervin B has the strongest inhibitory effect against HeLa cell growth among these four newly identified paucinervins and it may have the potential to be developed into a new anticancer candidate."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",AChE inhibition,"The study investigates the ability of methanolic extract of Andrographis paniculata MAP to supplement polyvalent anti-snake venom ASV in inhibiting neurotoxic enzyme acetylcholinesterase AChE and spreading factor hyaluronidase from Naja naja N.N venom. AChE and hyaluronidase activity were measured in 100 or 200 g of crude venom, respectively, and designated as control. In Test Group I, enzyme assays were performed immediately after the addition of ASV/MAP/ASV  MAP to the venom. Inhibition of AChE by ASV 100-367 g was 12-17, and of hyaluronidase 22-660 g was 33-41. Under the same conditions, MAP 100-400 g inhibited AChE and hyaluronidase to the extent of 17-33 and 17-52, respectively. When ASV 220 g and MAP 100-200 g were added together, AChE and hyaluronidase were inhibited to a greater extent from 39-63 to 36-44, than when either of them was used alone. In Test Group 2, the venom was incubated with ASV/MAP/ASV  MAP for 10-30 min at 37 C prior to the assay which enhanced AChE inhibition by 6, 82 and 18 respectively, when compared to Test Group I. Though there was no change in inhibition of hyaluronidase in the presence of ASV, MAP could further increase the extent of inhibition by 27 and ASV  MAP upto 4. In Test Group III, venom and substrate were incubated for 90 min and hyaluronidase activity was measured after the addition of inhibitors. Here, ASV  MAP caused increased inhibition by 69 compared to ASV alone. The study confirms the ability of phytochemicals in MAP to contribute to a multipronged strategy by supplementing, thereby augmenting the efficacy of ASV."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"The antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of pomegranate extract PE, as correlated with its prooxidant activity, were studied. PE exerted greater antiproliferative effects towards cancer, than to normal, cells, isolated from the human oral cavity. In cell-free systems, PE generated hydrogen peroxide H2O2 in cell culture media and in phosphate buffered saline, with prooxidant activity increasing from acidic to alkaline pH, and oxidized glutathione GSH in an alkaline, phosphate buffer. Detection of PE-generated H2O2 was greatly lessened in medium amended with N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Using HSC-2 carcinoma cells as the bioindicator, the cytotoxicity of PE was potentiated towards cells pretreated with the GSH depleter, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, and attenuated in cells co-treated with the H2O2 scavengers, catalase, pyruvate, and divalent cobalt ion. Intracellular GSH was lessened in cells treated with PE GSH depletion in PE-treated cells was confirmed visually with the fluorescent dye, Cell Tracker Green 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate. These studies demonstrated that the antiproliferative mechanism of PE was, in part, by induction of oxidative stress. The mode of cell death was by apoptosis, as shown by flow cytometry, activation of caspase-3, and cleavage of PARP. Lessening of caspase-3 activation and of PARP cleavage in cells co-treated with PE and either cobalt or pyruvate, respectively, as compared to PE alone, indicated that apoptosis was through the prooxidant nature of PE."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Studies examined the phenotypic characteristics of glutamate-induced cell death and their relationship to calpain and caspase-3 activation. Cell viability was assessed by fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide staining and lactate dehydrogenase release. Calpain and caspase-3 activity was inferred from signature proteolytic fragmentation of alpha-spectrin. Characterization of cell death phenotypes was assessed by Hoechst 33258 and DNA fragmentation assays. Exposure of septohippocampal cultures to 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mmol/L glutamate induced a dose-dependent cell death with an LD50 of 2.0 mmol/L glutamate after 24 hours of incubation. Glutamate treatment induced cell death in neurons and astroglia and produced morphological alterations that differed from necrotic or apoptotic changes observed after maitotoxin or staurosporine exposure, respectively. After glutamate treatment, cell nuclei were enlarged and eccentrically shaped, and aggregated chromatin appeared in a diffusely speckled pattern. Furthermore, no dose of glutamate produced evidence of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Incubation with varying doses of glutamate produced calpain and caspase-3 activation. Calpain inhibitor II N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-methionyl provided protection only with a narrow dose range, whereas carbobenzoxy-Asp-CH2-OCO-2,6-dichlorobenzene Z-D-DCB pan-caspase inhibitor and MK-801 N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist were potently effective across a wider dose range. Cycloheximide did not reduce cell death or protease activation."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",COX-2 inhibition,"BACKGROUND We have previously shown that cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 expression is low in the renal cortex of adult rats, but is increased in macula densa/cortical thick ascending limb and in glomerular podocytes after subtotal renal ablation.   METHODS To evaluate the functional consequences of this increased COX-2 expression, male rats were subjected to subtotal renal ablation and divided into four groups 1 treatment with the selective COX-2 inhibitor SC58236, 2 treatment with vehicle, 3 treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril, and 4 treatment with enalapril  SC58236. The administration of drugs was begun on the third day after ablation and continued for 6 to 10 weeks.   RESULTS Within one week after ablation, vehicle-treated rats developed hypertension. Although enalapril led to significant reductions in blood pressure, either alone or in combination with the COX-2 inhibitor, SC58236 alone did not significantly alter ablation-induced hypertension. However, the SC58236-treated animals exhibited levels of proteinuria at six weeks after ablation that were comparable to those seen with enalapril vehicle, 47 /- 4 enalapril, 27 /- 2 SC58236, 30 /- 2 mg/day N = 7, P lt 0.01, each group compared with vehicle, and continued SC58236 treatment led to persistent reductions in proteinuria at 10 weeks after renal ablation vehicle, 77 /- 4 SC58236, 50 /- 4 mg/day N = 6, P lt 0. 01. SC58236 treatment also significantly reduced the percentage of glomeruli exhibiting segmental or global sclerosis at 10 weeks 32.6 /- 7.8 vs. 10.9 /- 2.8, N = 6, P lt 0.03. Furthermore, SC58236 treatment partially inhibited increases in transforming growth factor-beta1 mRNA expression and increases in collagen III and collagen IV mRNA expression.   CONCLUSIONS These studies indicate that chronic treatment with a specific COX-2 inhibitor may retard the progression of progressive renal injury, and suggest that such compounds can be used in combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Further studies are required to determine the mechanism by which COX-2 inhibition is renoprotective."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Cervical cancer cell function is influence by ER. Therefore, in this study, ER stress senser-ATF6, was selected for detailed research in cervical cancer.   METHODS ATF6 mRNA was assessed through RT-qPCR assays. Cell transfection was to regulate ATF6 and thereafter the differential ATF6 cancer cells were divided into two groups for further functional assays. Cell viabilities were analyzed by CCK-8 and migration by Scratch. RT-qPCR examined cell death biomarkers Caspas-3 and Bcl-2. 4-PBA was utilized to inhibit ER stress. After that, ATF6, viability, migration and apoptotic proteins were scrutinized after ER inhibition. Proteins signifying EMT, autophagy and MAPK signaling pathway were checked by western bolt. Last, we inactivated the MAPK signaling to investigate into the changes in cell functions.   RESULTS ATF6 presented higher expression in cervical cancer cells. Inhibited ATF6 could reduce cell viabilities and migration but promote apoptosis through suppressing Bcl-2 and increasing caspase-3. ER stress antagonist witnessed a drop in ATF6 expression, cell viability, migration and Bcl-2 but a rise in caspase-3 activation, suggesting apoptosis increase. Cell autophagy was hindered in CC cells. Knockdown of ATF6 promoted autophagy and restrained EMT and MAPK signaling pathway. Suppressed ERK1/2 obstructed cell viabilities, migration, EMT and autophagy but promoted apoptosis.   CONCLUSION ATF6 might promote cell growth, migration, autophagy through ER stress and MAPK signaling in cervical cancer in vitro, indicating a potential regulatory gene in cervical cancer. However, in-depth researches are requested to enrich the knowledge of ATF6 in cervical cancer in vivo and in clinical in the future."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"The efficacy of taxanes on human leukemia cells is the object of intensive in vitro investigation concerning the influence of cell-type-specific characteristics on cytotoxic response to drugs. The present study dissects the response to taxanes of HL60 acute myelomonocytic leukemia and of K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia, in parallel over a 72-hr time-span. The kinetics of cytotoxicity following pulsed and continuous exposure to either taxol or taxotere showed a delayed response of K562 cells independently of dose and type of exposure. In K562 cells, apoptosis became evident at 48 hr and prominent at 72 hr of treatment. These events were mirrored by delayed kinetics of caspase-3 activation. Comparable microtubule targeting was demonstrated in HL60 and in K562 cell lines, as bcl-2 and raf-1 were phosphorylated following treatment with taxanes. These observations indicate that early activation processes were responsible for apoptosis, but that the delay was determined by other factors. In addition, cell-free-system experiments excluded the presence of excess nuclear and/or cytoplasmic inhibitory factors and demonstrated that K562 cells possess a fully competent caspase system which can be readily activated. Processing of caspase-3 pro-enzyme was in fact increased by addition of cytochrome c. These results extend to taxol and taxotere the notion that drug-induced apoptosis is delayed upstream of caspase-3 activation in K562 cells, that such kinetics is independent of drug concentration and exposure time, and that it is linked to intrinsic cellular characteristics mapping between bcl-2 phosphorylation and cytochrome c release."

Pretreatment with SS markedly protected mice from lethal liver injury, which has known to be associated with an abrupt elevation of serum tumor necrosis factor TNF- level. Indeed, SS significantly blocked the elevation of TNF- and alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase as well. SS also remarkably reduced number of apoptotic hepatocytes and DNA fragmentation in the liver, which correlated with blockade of caspase-3 activation. In addition, SS suppressed the increased expression of toll-like receptor 4 TLR4. The activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and p38 induced by D-GalN/LPS was also significantly suppressed by SS treatment. Furthermore, SS significantly inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-B. In RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with LPS, TNF- release and TLR4 expression was suppressed by SS pretreatment, which was in line with in vivo results. These findings suggested that SS prevents D-GalN/LPS-induced fulminant hepatic failure, and this protection is likely associated with its anti-apoptotic activity and the down-regulation of mitogen activated protein kinase activity associated at least in part with suppressing the transcription of LPS receptors."
"4,5-Dihydro-2-mercaptoimidazole",caspase-3 activation,"Combretastatin-A4 CA-4 is a natural derivative of the African willow tree Combretum caffrum. CA-4 is one of the most potent antimitotic components of natural origin, but it is, however, intrinsically unstable. A novel series of CA-4 analogs incorporating a 3,4-diaryl-2-azetidinone -lactam ring were designed and synthesized with the objective to prevent cis -trans isomerization and improve the intrinsic stability without altering the biological activity of CA-4. Evaluation of selected -lactam CA-4 analogs demonstrated potent antitubulin, antiproliferative, and antimitotic effects in human leukemia cells. A lead -lactam analog, CA-432, displayed comparable antiproliferative activities with CA-4. CA-432 induced rapid apoptosis in HL-60 acute myeloid leukemia cells, which was accompanied by depolymerization of the microtubular network, polyADP-ribose polymerase cleavage, caspase-3 activation, and Bcl-2 cleavage. A prolonged G2M cell cycle arrest accompanied by a sustained phosphorylation of mitotic spindle checkpoint protein, BubR1, and the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL preceded apoptotic events in K562 chronic myeloid leukemia CML cells. Molecular docking studies in conjunction with comprehensive cell line data rule out CA-4 and -lactam derivatives as P-glycoprotein substrates. Furthermore, both CA-4 and CA-432 induced significantly more apoptosis compared with imatinib mesylate in ex vivo samples from patients with CML, including those positive for the T315I mutation displaying resistance to imatinib mesylate and dasatinib. In summary, synthetic intrinsically stable analogs of CA-4 that display significant clinical potential as antileukemic agents have been designed and synthesized."

However, the involvement of viral genome-encoded proteins in this death process remains unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that the submajor capsid protein, VP3, up-regulates the pro-apoptotic protein, Bad, in fish and mouse cells. Western blot analysis revealed that VP3 was expressed in CHSE-214 cells at 4 h post-infection pi, indicating an early role during viral replication. We cloned the VP3 gene and tested its function in fish and mouse cells VP3 overexpression induced apoptotic cell death by TUNEL assay. In addition, it up-regulated Bad gene expression in zebrafish ZLE cells by threefold at 12 h post-transfection pt and in mouse NIH3T3 cells by tenfold at 24 h pt. VP3 up-regulation of Bad expression altered mitochondria function, inducing mitochondrial membrane potential MMP loss and activating initiator caspase-9 and effector caspase-3. Furthermore, reduced Bad expression 65 reduction, MMP loss up to 40, and enhanced cell viability up to 60 upon expression of VP3 antisense RNA in CHSE-214 cells at 24 h post-IPNV infection was observed. Finally, overexpression of the anti-apoptotic gene, zfBcl-xL, reduced VP3-induced apoptotic cell death and caspase-3 activation at 24 h in fish cells. Taken together, these results suggest that aquatic birnavirus VP3 induces apoptosis via up-regulation of Bad expression and mitochondrial disruption, which activates a downstream caspase-3-mediated death pathway that is blocked by zfBcl-xL."
"4-Chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthio) acetic acid (Pirinixic acid)",PPARgamma activation,"Rodent brown adipocytes express peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha PPARalpha and PPARgamma and while the rodent uncoupling protein-1 UCP-1 gene contains a putative peroxisome proliferator response element PPRE, only PPARgamma activation by thiazolidinediones increase UCP-1 mRNA levels. We have investigated this phenomenon in foetal rat brown adipocytes FBA and show that although transactivation occurs in FBA containing a plasmid encoding 4.5kb of the 5-flanking region of the rat UCP-1 promoter -4551-UCP-1-CAT treated with either the selective PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone 1.0 microM or the selective PPARalpha agonist Wy 14643 10.0 microM, only rosiglitazone induced transcription of UCP-1 mRNA. Furthermore, Wy 14643 10 and 100.0 microM abolished rosiglitazone-induced UCP-1 mRNA induction in spite of a transactivation event occurring with the combination treatment. Thus in FBA PPARalpha-activation with Wy 14643 elicits a ""blind"" transactivation of the UCP-1 promoter which can prevent PPARgamma-mediated UCP-1 mRNA transcription either by competition for the PPRE or by an unidentified post-transcriptional event."
"4-Chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthio) acetic acid (Pirinixic acid)",PPARgamma activation,"High expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha PPARalpha differentiates brown fat from white, and is related to its high capacity of lipid oxidation. We analyzed the effects of PPARalpha activation on expression of the brown fat-specific uncoupling protein-1 ucp-1 gene. Activators of PPARalpha increased UCP-1 mRNA levels severalfold both in primary brown adipocytes and in brown fat in vivo. Transient transfection assays indicated that the -4551UCP1-CAT construct, containing the 5-regulatory region of the rat ucp-1 gene, was activated by PPARalpha co-transfection in a dose-dependent manner and this activation was potentiated by Wy 14,643 and retinoid X receptor alpha. The coactivators CBP and PPARgamma-coactivator-1 PGC-1, which is highly expressed in brown fat, also enhanced the PPARalpha-dependent regulation of the ucp-1 gene. Deletion and point-mutation mapping analysis indicated that the PPARalpha-responsive element was located in the upstream enhancer region of the ucp-1 gene. This -2485/-2458 element bound PPARalpha and PPARgamma from brown fat nuclei. Moreover, this element behaved as a promiscuous responsive site to either PPARalpha or PPARgamma activation, and we propose that it mediates ucp-1 gene up-regulation associated with adipogenic differentiation via PPARgamma or in coordination with gene expression for the fatty acid oxidation machinery required for active thermogenesis via PPARalpha."
"4-Chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthio) acetic acid (Pirinixic acid)",PPARgamma activation,"Uncoupling proteins UCPs are mitochondrial membrane proton transporters that uncouple respiration from oxidative phosphorylation by dissipating the proton gradient across the membrane. We studied the direct effect of several peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPAR ligands on UCP-3 and UCP-2 mRNA expression in C2C12 myotubes for 24 h. In the absence of exogenous fatty acids, treatment of C2C12 cells with a selective PPARalpha activator Wy-14,643 or a non-selective PPAR activator bezafibrate did not affect the expression of UCP-3 mRNA levels, whereas UCP-2 expression was slightly increased. In contrast, troglitazone, a thiazolidinedione which selectively activates PPARgamma, strongly decreased UCP-3 and UCP-2 mRNA levels. Another thiazolidinedione, ciglitazone, had the same effect, but to a lower extent, suggesting that PPARgamma activation is involved. Further, the presence of 0.5 mM oleic acid strongly increased UCP-3 mRNA levels and troglitazone addition failed to block the effect of this fatty acid. The drop in UCP expression after thiazolidinedione treatment correlated well with a reduction in PPARalpha mRNA levels produced by this drug, linking the reduction in PPARalpha mRNA levels with the down-regulation of UCP mRNA in C2C12 myotubes after thiazolidinedione treatment."

Recent studies have focused on the role of adipocytokines in metabolic control and their regulation by TZDs. In this study, we compared the chronic effects of antihyperglycemic doses of the TZD rosiglitazone, the beta3-adrenoceptor agonist BRL-35135, and the PPARalpha agonist Wy-14,643 on the mRNA expression of adipocytokines in WAT of db/db mice. Rosiglitazone treatment decreased adiponectin and resistin mRNA levels by 57 and 72, respectively P lt 0.001, with no effect on the level of TNFalpha or RELMalpha transcripts. In comparison, Wy-14,643 reduced adiponectin transcript levels by 31 P = 0.015 while BRL-35135 increased RELMalpha mRNA expression by 245 P lt 0.001 without effect on the other transcripts. Our results indicate that although a reduction in adiponectin and resistin mRNA levels in WAT by rosiglitazone treatment of diabetic mice may contribute to the antidiabetic effects, an alteration in TNFalpha, adiponectin, resistin, or RELMalpha mRNA expression is not absolutely required for the regulation of blood glucose concentration in the db/db mouse."
"4-Chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthio) acetic acid (Pirinixic acid)",COX-2 inhibition,"Overexpression of the inducible cyclooxygenase COX-2 and inducible NO synthase iNOS in activated brain macrophages microglia and astrocytes appears central to many neuroinflammatory conditions. 15-Deoxy-Delta12,14-PGJ2 15d-PGJ2 is a ligand for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPARgamma. It has been proposed as an inhibitor of microglial activation, based on the study of iNOS down-regulation in rodent microglia. Because iNOS induction after cytokine activation remains controversial in human microglia, we examined the effect of 15d-PGJ2 and other PPAR agonists on human microglia and astrocytes, using COX-2 induction as an index of activation. We found that PPAR alpha ligands clofibrate and WY14643 enhanced IL-1 beta-induced COX-2 expression in human astrocytes and microglia, while inhibiting IL-1 beta plus IFN-gamma induction of iNOS in astrocytes. This is the first description of an inhibition of iNOS uncoupled from that of COX-2. 15d-PGJ2 suppressed COX-2 induction in human astrocytes. It prevented NF-kappa B binding to the COX-2 promoter through a new pathway that is the repression of NF-kappa Bp50 induction by IL-1 beta. In contrast, 15d-PGJ2 increased c-Jun and c-Fos DNA-binding activity in astrocytes, which may result in the activation of other inflammatory pathways. In human microglia, no effect of 15d-PGJ2 on COX-2 and NF-kappa Bp65/p50 induction was observed. However, the entry of 15d-PGJ2 occurred in microglia because STAT-1 and c-Jun expression was modulated. Our data suggest the existence of novel pathways mediated by 15d-PGJ2 in human astrocytes. They also demonstrate that, unlike astrocytes and peripheral macrophages or rodent brain macrophages, human microglia are not subject to the anti-inflammatory effect of 15d-PGJ2 in terms of COX-2 inhibition."
"4-Chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthio) acetic acid (Pirinixic acid)",PPARgamma activation,"BACKGROUND Thiazolidinediones as PPARgamma agonists and fibrates as PPARalpha agonists improve insulin sensitivity in insulin-responsive tissues. Recent data show an induction of adiponectin receptor 2 AdipoR2 by PPARalpha and PPARgamma agonists in human macrophages.   OBJECTIVE In this study, we examined the effects of thiazolidinediones and fibrates on the expression of adiponectin receptors in human skeletal muscle cells, an important cell type in the context of insulin resistance.   RESULTS AND METHODS In vitro differentiated human myotubes treated with troglitazone or rosiglitazone 20 h showed no significant changes in AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 mRNA expression. PPARgamma activation was controlled by determination of PPARgamma mRNA induction. Likewise, differentiated myotubes treated with Wy-14,643 or fenofibrate 20 h revealed no significant regulation of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 mRNA. PPARalpha activation was assessed by measuring PDHK4 mRNA expression.   CONCLUSION Induction of AdipoR gene expression in human skeletal muscle cells is not involved in the insulin-sensitizing effects of thiazolidinediones or fibrates."
"4-Chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthio) acetic acid (Pirinixic acid)",PPARgamma activation,"We have examined over the course of a 1-week period the independent and combined effects of chronically increased muscle contraction and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPARalpha and PPARgamma activators, Wy 14,643 and rosiglitazone, on the expression and plasmalemmal content of the fatty acid transporters, FAT/CD36 and FABPpm, as well as on the rate of fatty acid transport. In resting muscle, the activation of either PPARalpha or PPARgamma failed to induce the protein expression of FAT/CD36. PPARalpha activation also failed to induce the protein expression of FABPpm. In contrast, PPARgamma activation induced the expression of FABPpm protein 40 P lt 0.05. Chronic muscle contraction increased the protein expression of FAT/CD36 approximately 50 P lt 0.05, whereas FABPpm was slightly increased 12 P lt 0.05. Neither PPARalpha nor PPARgamma activation altered the contraction-induced expression of FAT/CD36 or FABPpm. Changes in protein expression of FAT/CD36 or FABPpm, induced by either contractions or by administration of rosiglitazone, were largely attributable to increased transcription. The contraction-induced increments in FAT/CD36 were accompanied by parallel increments in plasmalemmal FAT/CD36 and in rates of fatty acid transport P lt 0.05. Up-regulation of FABPpm expression was, however, accompanied by a reduction in plasmalemmal FABPpm, which did not affect the rates of long chain fatty acid LCFA transport. These studies have shown that in skeletal muscle i neither PPARalpha nor PPARgamma activation alters FAT/CD36 expression, ii PPARgamma activation selectively up-regulates FABPpm expression and iii contraction-induced up-regulation of LCFA transport does not appear to occur via activation of either PPARalpha or PPARgamma."
"4-Chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthio) acetic acid (Pirinixic acid)",caspase-3 activation,"Chronic exposure to peroxisome proliferators PPs leads to increased incidence of liver tumors in rodents. Liver tumor induction is thought to require increased hepatocyte proliferation and suppression of apoptosis. Transcript profiling showed increased expression of proapoptotic genes and decreased expression of antiapoptotic genes in the livers of mice exposed to the PP WY-14,643 WY. We tested the hypothesis that prior exposure to WY would increase susceptibility to apoptosis inducers such as Jo2, an antibody which activates the Fas Apo-1/CD95 death pathway. When compared to their untreated counterparts, wild-type mice pretreated with WY exhibited increased caspase-3 activation and hepatocyte apoptosis following challenge with Jo2. Livers from WY-treated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha PPARalpha-null mice were resistant to the effects of Jo2. In the absence of Jo2 and detectable apoptosis, wild-type mice treated with WY exhibited increases in the activated form of caspase-9. As caspase-9 is a component of the apoptosome, we examined the expression of upstream effectors of apoptosome activity including members of the Bcl-2 family. The levels of the antiapoptotic Mcl-1 transcript and protein were significantly decreased by PPs. PPARalpha-null mice were also resistant to another treatment concanavalin A that induces hepatocyte apoptosis. These results 1 indicate that PPARalpha activation increases sensitivity of the liver to apoptosis and 2 identify a mechanism by which PPARalpha could serve as a pharmacological target in diseases where apoptosis is a contributing feature."
"4-Chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthio) acetic acid (Pirinixic acid)",PPARgamma activation,"PURPOSE Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors PPARs are lipid sensors and when activated they modify gene expression of proteins regulating fatty acid FA metabolism in liver cells. The aim of the present study was to examine the in vivo effects of PPAR alpha and gamma activation combined with high fat diet HFD feeding on the lipid content and FA profile in the liver.   MATERIAL/METHODS We assessed whether in vivo activation of PPARs alpha or gamma affects lipid accumulation in the liver induced by HFD feeding. Furthermore, as PPAR activity may be a key factor regulating long chain fatty acids LCFA flux and subsequent LCFA utilization in the liver, we prompted to investigate also the FA profile in different lipid fractions in this tissue.   RESULTS PPARalpha agonist WY 14,643 treatment reduced the accumulation of liver lipids free fatty acids FFA-30, diacylglycerols DAG -27 and triacylglycerols TAG -60, plt0.05 evoked by HFD feeding. Interestingly, with PPARgamma stimulation liver lipid content was further elevated comparing to the effects of HFD phospholipids PL 48, DAG 231, TAG 346, plt0.05.   CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that in vivo PPARalpha and PPARgamma activation combined with HFD feeding exert different effects on lipid content in rats liver and in vivo PPARalpha activation may prevent lipid overload in the liver cells provoked by HFD feeding."
"4-Chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthio) acetic acid (Pirinixic acid)",PPARgamma activation,"Skeletal muscle pathology associated with a chronic inflammatory disease state e.g., skeletal muscle atrophy and insulin resistance is a potential consequence of chronic activation of NF-kappaB. It has been demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors PPARs can exert anti-inflammatory effects by interfering with transcriptional regulation of inflammatory responses. The goal of the present study, therefore, was to evaluate whether PPAR activation affects cytokine-induced NF-kappaB activity in skeletal muscle. Using C2C12 myotubes as an in vitro model of myofibers, we demonstrate that PPAR, and specifically PPARgamma, activation potently inhibits inflammatory mediator-induced NF-kappaB transcriptional activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, PPARgamma activation by rosiglitazone strongly suppresses cytokine-induced transcript levels of the NF-kappaB-dependent genes intracellular adhesion molecule 1 ICAM-1 and CXCL1 KC, the murine homolog of IL-8, in myotubes. To verify whether muscular NF-kappaB activity in human subjects is suppressed by PPARgamma activation, we examined the effect of 8 wk of rosiglitazone treatment on muscular gene expression of ICAM-1 and IL-8 in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. In these subjects, we observed a trend toward decreased basal expression of ICAM-1 mRNA levels. Subsequent analyses in cultured myotubes revealed that the anti-inflammatory effect of PPARgamma activation is not due to decreased RelA translocation to the nucleus or reduced RelA DNA binding. These findings demonstrate that muscle-specific inhibition of NF-kappaB activation may be an interesting therapeutic avenue for treatment of several inflammation-associated skeletal muscle abnormalities."
"4-Chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthio) acetic acid (Pirinixic acid)",PPARgamma activation,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors PPARs serve as lipid sensors and when activated modify gene expression of proteins highly involved in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism. Recently, the accumulation of lipids in liver was shown to be depended on the excessive protein-mediated transmembrane transport of long chain fatty acids LCFAs. The aim of the present study was to determine the in vivo effects of PPARalpha and gamma activation at two levels 1 on the expression of fatty acid transporters, 2 on the content and fatty acids saturation status of lipids in rats liver. PPARalpha agonist WY 14,643 treatment upregulated the liver expression of FAT/CD36 20, plt0.05 and did not significantly affect the content of FABPpm and FATP-1. Accordingly there was a significant increase in the content of phospholipid 12, plt0.05, diacylglycerol 65, plt0.05 and triacylglycerol 46, plt0.05 fractions followed PPARalpha activation. In contrast, pioglitazone PPARgamma agonist had no effect on the content of fatty acid transporters FAT/CD36, FABPpm and FATP-1 as well as the content of liver lipid fractions with the exception for triacylglycerols, which have been reduced significantly -89, plt0.05. These findings suggest that in vivo PPARalpha and PPARgamma activation exert different effects on both the expression of fatty acid transporters and lipid content in rats liver."
Acetaminophen,COX-2 inhibition,"BACKGROUND Eighty percent of all breast cancers and almost 90 of breast cancer deaths occur among post-menopausal women. We used a nested case control design to examine the association between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug NSAID use and breast cancer occurrence among women over 65 years of age. The cyclooxygenase COX-2 enzyme is expressed more in breast cancers than in normal breast tissue. COX-2 inhibition may have a role in breast cancer prevention.   METHODS In the Canadian province of Quebec, physician services are covered through a governmental insurance plan. Medication costs are covered for those gt or = 65 years of age and a publicly funded screening program for breast cancer targets all women 50 years of age or older. We obtained encrypted data from these insurance databases on all women gt or = 65 years of age who filled a prescription for COX-2 inhibitors, non-selective NSAIDs ns-NSAIDs, aspirin, or acetaminophen between January 1998 and December 2002. Cases were defined as those women who have undergone mammography between April 2001 and June 2002 and had a diagnosis of breast cancer within six months following mammography. Controls included those who have undergone mammography between April 2001 and June 2002 without a diagnosis of any cancer during the six months following mammography. The exposure of interest, frequent NSAID use, was defined as use of ns-NSAIDs and/or COX-2 inhibitors for gt or = 90 days during the year prior to mammography. Frequent use served as a convenient proxy for long term chronic use.   RESULTS We identified 1,090 cases and 44,990 controls. Cases were older and more likely to have breast cancer risk factors. Logistic regression models adjusting for potential confounders showed that frequent use of ns-NSAIDs and/or COX-2 inhibitors was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer OR 0.75, 95 confidence interval 0.64-0.89. Results were similar for COX-2 inhibitors 0.81, 0.68-0.97 and ns-NSAIDs 0.65, 0.43-0.99, when assessed separately. Frequent use of aspirin at doses gt 100 mg/day in the year prior to mammography was also associated with a lower risk of breast cancer 0.75, 0.64-0.89. However, use of aspirin at doses lt or = 100 mg/day did not have any association with breast cancer 0.91, 0.71-1.16.   CONCLUSION Women who use NSAIDs or doses of aspirin gt 100 mg frequently may have a lower risk of breast cancer."
Acetaminophen,COX-2 inhibition,"BACKGROUND amp AIMS It has been variably suggested that nonselective NSAIDs and cyclooxygenase COX-2 selective inhibitors aggravate or ameliorate clinical disease activity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We assessed the effect of these drugs in patients with inflammatory bowel disease n = 209 and the possible mechanisms.   METHODS First, patients with quiescent Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis received the non-NSAID analgesic acetaminophen n = 26 and the conventional NSAIDs naproxen n = 32, diclofenac n = 29, and indomethacin n = 22 for 4 weeks. The Harvey-Bradshaw index was used to define relapse. Second, to assess the mechanism of relapse, intestinal inflammation was quantitated fecal calprotectin before and during treatment 20 patients/group with acetaminophen, naproxen topical effect, COX-1 and -2 inhibitor, nabumetone COX-1 and -2 inhibitor, nimesulide selective COX-2 inhibitor, and low-dose aspirin selective COX-1 inhibition.   RESULTS Nonselective NSAIDs were associated with a 17-28 relapse rate within 9 days of ingestion. No patient had an early relapse on acetaminophen, nimesulide, or aspirin, whereas those on naproxen and nabumetone 20 experienced relapse. These clinical relapses were associated with escalating intestinal inflammatory activity.   CONCLUSIONS NSAID ingestion is associated with frequent and early clinical relapse of quiescent inflammatory bowel disease, and the mechanism appears to be due to dual inhibition of the COX enzymes. Selective COX-2 inhibition with nimesulide and COX-1 inhibition with low-dose aspirin appear to be well-tolerated in the short-term."
Acetaminophen,COX-2 inhibition,"The present study was aimed to test the possible cyclooxygenase COX-1/COX-2 selectivity of the old analgesic drug phenacetin and its metabolite p-phenetidine, which exhibits high renal toxicity. Paracetamol acetaminophen, the main metabolite of phenacetin with low renal toxicity, and indomethacin were selected as reference compounds. Collagen-stimulated platelet thromboxane B2 TxB2 production and phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate PMA-induced neutrophil prostaglandin E2 PGE2 synthesis were used as indicators for COX-1 and COX-2 activity, respectively. Phenacetin was even less potent than paracetamol to reduce the production of both TxB2 and PGE2, and no clear preference for either of the COX-enzymes was seen. P-phenetidine was a more potent inhibitor, already at nanomolar level, of the synthesis of these prostanoids than indomethacin and showed some preference to COX-2 inhibition. Somewhat higher, micromolar, concentrations of p-phenetidine also reduced COX-2 expression in neutrophils. We suggest that the very potent inhibitory activity of p-phenetidine on PGE2 synthesis combined with the reduction of COX-2 expression could explain the renal papillary necrosis in phenacetin kidney."
Acetaminophen,caspase-3 activation,"There is a growing need for pharmacological agents to manage cardiovascular disease in the rapidly growing elderly population. Here, we determine if acetaminophen is efficacious in decreasing age-related increases in cardiac reactive oxygen species ROS and apoptosis in aging Fischer 344 X Brown Norway rats. Compared to 6-month control animals, indices of oxidative superoxide anion O2- and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal 4-HNE and nitrosative protein nitrotyrosylation stress were markedly increased in 33-month-old rat hearts. 33-month animals that had been treated with acetaminophen 30 mg/kg/day p.o. for 6 months exhibited diminished age-related increases in cardiac ROS levels and TUNEL positive nuclei and these changes were accompanied by improvements in the Bax/Bcl2 ratio, diminished evidence of caspase-3 activation and increased phosphorylation of protein kinase B, ERK1/2, p70S6K and GSK-3beta. Taken together these results suggests that acetaminophen may attenuate the age-associated increases in the cardiomyocyte apoptosis, possibly via diminishing age associated elevation in ROS production."
Acetaminophen,caspase-3 activation,"In vitro cell models, which can partially mimic in vivo responses, offer potentially sensitive tools for toxicological assessment. The objective of this study was to explore the possible mechanisms of acetaminophen AP-induced toxicity in human normal liver L-02 cells. The expression of the CYP2E1 enzyme, which is reported to transform AP to its toxic metabolites, was higher in L-02 than in Hep3B cells. Further cell viability and reduced glutathione GSH depletion after AP treatment were examined. After exposure to AP for 24 h, cell viability decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. Concentration-dependent GSH depletion was also observed after AP treatment for 48 h, indicating oxidative stress had occurred in L-02 cells. The effects of D, L-buthionine-S, R-sulfoximine BSO, an inhibitor of GSH biosynthesis, and N-acetylcysteine NAC, a precursor of GSH synthesis, on the cytotoxicity induced by AP were also investigated. BSO aggravated the cytotoxicity induced by AP while NAC ameliorated such cell death. Further results showed that 10 mM AP caused cell apoptosis after 48 h treatment based on the DNA fragmentation assay and western blot of caspase-3 activation, respectively. In addition, the protective effects of various well-known antioxidants against AP-induced hepatotoxicity were observed. Taken together, these results indicate that oxidative stress and cellular apoptosis are involved in AP-induced toxicity in human normal liver L-02 cells, and this cell line is a suitable in vitro cell model for AP hepatotoxicity study."
Acetaminophen,COX-2 inhibition,"For more than three decades, acetaminophen INN, paracetamol has been claimed to be devoid of significant inhibition of peripheral prostanoids. Meanwhile, attempts to explain its action by inhibition of a central cyclooxygenase COX-3 have been rejected. The fact that acetaminophen acts functionally as a selective COX-2 inhibitor led us to investigate the hypothesis of whether it works via preferential COX-2 blockade. Ex vivo COX inhibition and pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen were assessed in 5 volunteers receiving single 1000 mg doses orally. Coagulation-induced thromboxane B2 and lipopolysaccharide-induced prostaglandin E2 were measured ex vivo and in vitro in human whole blood as indices of COX-1 and COX-2 activity. In vitro, acetaminophen elicited a 4.4-fold selectivity toward COX-2 inhibition IC50=113.7 micromol/L for COX-1 IC50=25.8 micromol/L for COX-2. Following oral administration of the drug, maximal ex vivo inhibitions were 56 COX-1 and 83 COX-2. Acetaminophen plasma concentrations remained above the in vitro IC50 for COX-2 for at least 5 h postadministration. Ex vivo IC50 values COX-1 105.2 micromol/L COX-2 26.3 micromol/L of acetaminophen compared favorably with its in vitro IC50 values. In contrast to previous concepts, acetaminophen inhibited COX-2 by more than 80, i.e., to a degree comparable to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors. However, a gt95 COX-1 blockade relevant for suppression of platelet function was not achieved. Our data may explain acetaminophens analgesic and antiinflammatory action as well as its superior overall gastrointestinal safety profile compared with NSAIDs. In view of its substantial COX-2 inhibition, recently defined cardiovascular warnings for use of COX-2 inhibitors should also be considered for acetaminophen."
Acetaminophen,COX-2 inhibition,"AIMS This study is aimed at the evaluation of antipyretic effect of PHY in yeast-induced hyperthermia rats. Additionally, possible mechanism of antipyretic action of PHY has been also studied by molecular docking study.   METHODS Adult male Wistar albino rats were treated with PHY at 100, 150 and 200 mg/kg in 0.05 Tween-80 dissolved in 0.9 NaCl solution. PHY was also given at 200 mg/kg with ibuprofen IBU 12.5 mg/kg p.o. or paracetamol PARA 100 mg/kg p.o. to see the combined effect of PHY in animals. In silico study of PHY was performed against cyclooxygenase COX enzymes COX-1 and -2 proteins.   RESULTS PHY exhibited the antipyretic effect in febrile rats in a dose and time dependent manner. PHY 200 mg/kg co-treated with IBU12.5 or PARA100 exhibited greater antipyretic effect than the PHY or NSAIDs individual groups. Data from the computational study reveal that 5KIR of COX-2 is the most efficient receptor protein to which PHY interacts.   CONCLUSION PHY attributed an antipyretic effect, possibly via 5KIR-dependent COX-2 inhibition pathway."
Acetaminophen,caspase-3 activation,"Acetaminophen overdose causes massive hepatic failure via mechanisms involving glutathione depletion, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The ultimate target of acetaminophen causing cell death remains uncertain, and the role of apoptosis in acetaminophen-induced cell killing is still controversial. Our aim was to evaluate the mitochondrial permeability transition MPT as a key factor in acetaminophen-induced necrotic and apoptotic killing of primary cultured mouse hepatocytes. After administration of 10 mmol/L acetaminophen, necrotic killing increased to more than 49 and 74, respectively, after 6 and 16 hours. MPT inhibitors, cyclosporin A CsA, and NIM811 temporarily decreased necrotic killing after 6 hours to 26, but cytoprotection was lost after 16 hours. Confocal microscopy revealed mitochondrial depolarization and inner membrane permeabilization approximately 4.5 hours after acetaminophen administration. CsA delayed these changes, indicative of the MPT, to approximately 11 hours after acetaminophen administration. Apoptosis indicated by nuclear changes, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, and caspase-3 activation also increased after acetaminophen administration. Fructose 20 mmol/L, an adenosine triphosphate-generating glycolytic substrate plus glycine 5 mmol/L, a membrane stabilizing amino acid prevented nearly all necrotic cell killing but paradoxically increased apoptosis from 37 to 59 after 16 hours. In the presence of fructose plus glycine, CsA decreased apoptosis and delayed but did not prevent the MPT. In conclusion, after acetaminophen a CsA-sensitive MPT occurred after 3 to 6 hours followed by a CsA-insensitive MPT 9 to 16 hours after acetaminophen. The MPT then induces ATP depletion-dependent necrosis or caspase-dependent apoptosis as determined, in part, by ATP availability from glycolysis."
Acetaminophen,COX-2 inhibition,"Cardiovascular risk led to the withdrawal of Vioxx rofecoxib in 2004. Some related drugs also increase cardiovascular risk and cyclooxygenase COX-2 inhibitors that remain on the market, including unselective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs, have not been exonerated. This article reviews if new evidence should change clinical and regulatory practice. Substantial COX-2 inhibition increases the incidence of cardiovascular disease unless concomitant platelet thromboxane production is inhibited by gt95. This can be investigated using whole blood assays, an approach used recently to show that acetaminophen paracetamol is a COX-2-selective inhibitor. The epidemiology available suggests acetaminophen, though readily available over-the-counter, does increase cardiovascular risk. Current evidence is inadequate to recommend many potential alternatives to Vioxx as safe. We argue that the precautionary principle, first do no harm, should underpin the regulation and prescribing of NSAIDs. Labelling which identifies these risks for prescribers and consumers should be mandatory."
Acetaminophen,caspase-3 activation,"AIM To investigate the in vivo hepatoprotective effects and mechanisms of Gentiana manshurica Kitagawa GM in acetaminophen APAP-induced liver injury in mice.   METHODS GM 200, 150 or 50 mg/kg body weight or N-acetyl-L-cysteine NAC 300 mg/kg body weight was administrated orally with a single dose 2 h prior to APAP 300 mg/kg body weight injection in mice.   RESULTS APAP treatment significantly depleted hepatic glutathione GSH, increased serum aspartate aminotransferase AST, alanine aminotransferase ALT and malonyldialdehyde MDA and 4-hydroxynonenal levels, and decreased hepatic activity of glutathione peroxidase GSH-px and superoxide dismutase SOD. However, the pretreatment of GM significantly alleviated APAP-induced oxidative stress by increasing GSH content, decreasing serum ALT, AST and MDA, and retaining the activity of GSH-px and SOD in the liver. Furthermore, GM pretreatment can inhibit caspase-3 activation and phosphorylation of c-Jun-NH2-terminal protein kinase 2 JNK1/2 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK. GM also remarkably attenuated hepatocyte apoptosis confirmed by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end-labeling method.   CONCLUSION Hepatoprotective effects of GM against APAP-induced acute toxicity are mediated either by preventing the decline of hepatic antioxidant status or its direct anti-apoptosis capacity. These results support that GM is a potent hepatoprotective agent."
Acetaminophen,caspase-3 activation,"N,N-Dimethylformamide DMF is an organic solvent extensively used in industries such as synthetic leather, fibers and films, and induces liver toxicity and carcinogenesis. Despite a series of experimental and clinical reports on DMF-induced liver failure, the mechanism of toxicity is yet unclear. This study investigated whether DMF in combination with a low dose of hepatotoxicant enhances hepatotoxicity, and if so, on what mechanistic basis. Treatment of rats with either DMF 50-500mg/kg/day, for 3 days or a single low dose of CCl4 0.2ml/kg alone caused small increases in plasma transaminases and lactate dehydrogenase activities. However, combinatorial treatment of DMF with CCl4 markedly increased blood biochemical changes. Histopathology confirmed the synergism in hepatotoxicity. Moreover, DMFCCl4 caused PARP cleavage and caspase-3 activation, but decreased the level of Bcl-xL, all of which confirmed apoptosis of hepatocytes. Consistently, DMFCCl4 treatment markedly increased lipid peroxidation. By contrast, treatment of DMF in combination with lipopolysaccharide, acetaminophen or d-galactosamine caused no enhanced hepatotoxicity. Given the link between endoplasmic reticulum ER dysfunction and cell death, ER stress response was monitored after DMF and/or CCl4 treatment. Whereas either DMF or CCl4 treatment alone marginally changed the expression levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 and 94 and phosphorylated PKR-like ER-localized eIF2alpha kinase, concomitant treatment with DMF and CCl4 synergistically induced them with increases in glucose-regulated protein 78 and C/EBP homologous protein mRNAs. Our results demonstrate that DMF treatment in combination with CCl4 synergistically increases hepatocyte death, which may be associated with the induction of severe ER stress."
Acetaminophen,caspase-3 activation,"UNLABELLED The mechanisms of acetaminophen APAP-mediated hepatic oncotic necrosis have been extensively characterized. However, it was recently demonstrated that fed CD-1 mice have a transient caspase activation which initiates apoptosis. To evaluate these findings in more detail, outbred Swiss Webster, SW and inbred C57BL/6 mice were treated with APAP with or without pan-caspase inhibitor and compared to the apoptosis model of galactosamine GalN/endotoxin ET. Fasted or fed APAP-treated C57BL/6 mice showed no evidence of caspase-3 processing or activity. Interestingly, a minor, temporary increase in caspase-3 processing and activity 150 above baseline was observed after APAP treatment only in fed SW mice. The degree of caspase-3 activation in SW mice after APAP was minor compared to that observed in GalN/ET-treated mice 1600 above baseline. The pancaspase inhibitor attenuated caspase activation and resulted in increased APAP-induced injury plasma ALT, necrosis scoring. The caspase inhibitor did not affect apoptosis because regardless of treatment only lt0.5 of hepatocytes showed consistent apoptotic morphology after APAP. In contrast, gt20 apoptotic cells were observed in GalN/ET-treated mice. Presence of the caspase inhibitor altered hepatic glutathione levels in SW mice, which could explain the exacerbation of injury. Additionally, the infiltration of hepatic neutrophils was not altered by the fed state of either mouse strain.   CONCLUSION Minor caspase-3 activation without apoptotic cell death can be observed only in fed mice of some outbred strains. These findings suggest that although the severity of APAP-induced liver injury varies between fed and fasted animals, the mechanism of cell death does not fundamentally change."
Acetaminophen,COX-2 inhibition,"Paracetamol is recommended as first-line therapy for pain associated with osteoarthrosis and is one of the most widely used over-the-counter analgesic drugs worldwide. Despite its extensive use, its mode of action is still unclear. Although it is commonly stated that paracetamol acts centrally, recent data imply an inhibitory effect on the activity of peripheral prostaglandin-synthesising cyclooxygenase enzymes. In this context paracetamol has been suggested to inhibit both isoforms in tissues with low levels of peroxide by reducing the higher oxidation state of cyclooxygenase enzymes. Two recent studies have also demonstrated a preferential cyclooxygenase 2 COX-2 inhibition by paracetamol under different clinically relevant conditions. This review attempts to relate data on paracetamols inhibitory action on peripheral cyclooxygenase enzymes to the published literature on its anti-inflammatory action and its hitherto underestimated side-effects elicited by cyclooxygenase inhibition. As a result, a pronounced COX-2 inhibition by paracetamol is expected to occur in the endothelium, possibly explaining its cardiovascular risk in epidemiological studies. A careful analysis of paracetamols cardiovascular side-effects in randomised studies is therefore strongly advised. On the basis of epidemiological data showing an increased gastrointestinal risk of paracetamol at high doses or when co-administered with classic cyclooxygenase inhibitors, paracetamols long-term gastrointestinal impact should be investigated in randomised trials. Finally, paracetamols fast elimination and consequently short-lived COX-2 inhibition, which requires repetitive dosing, should be definitely considered to avoid overdosage leading to hepatotoxicity."
Acetaminophen,COX-2 inhibition,"Long-lasting confusion and memory difficulties during the postictal state remain a major unmet problem in epilepsy that lacks pathophysiological explanation and treatment. We previously identified that long-lasting periods of severe postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxia, not seizures per se, are associated with memory impairment after temporal lobe seizures. While this observation suggests a key pathophysiological role for insufficient energy delivery, it is unclear how the networks that underlie episodic memory respond to vascular constraints that ultimately give rise to amnesia. Here, we focused on cellular/network level analyses in the CA1 of hippocampus in vivo to determine if neural activity, network oscillations, synaptic transmission, and/or synaptic plasticity are impaired following kindled seizures. Importantly, the induction of severe postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxia was prevented in animals treated by a COX-2 inhibitor, which experimentally separated seizures from their vascular consequences. We observed complete activation of CA1 pyramidal neurons during brief seizures, followed by a short period of reduced activity and flattening of the local field potential that resolved within minutes. During the postictal state, constituting tens of minutes to hours, we observed no changes in neural activity, network oscillations, and synaptic transmission. However, long-term potentiation of the temporoammonic pathway to CA1 was impaired in the postictal period, but only when severe local hypoxia occurred. Lastly, we tested the ability of rats to perform object-context discrimination, which has been proposed to require temporoammonic input to differentiate between sensory experience and the stored representation of the expected object-context pairing. Deficits in this task following seizures were reversed by COX-2 inhibition, which prevented severe postictal hypoxia. These results support a key role for hypoperfusion/hypoxia in postictal memory impairments and identify that many aspects of hippocampal network function are resilient during severe hypoxia except for long-term synaptic plasticity."
Acetaminophen,caspase-3 activation,"Acetaminophen APAP overdose can cause severe liver damage, but therapeutic options are limited. Apamin is a natural peptide present in bee venom and has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Accumulating evidence suggests that apamin has favorable actions in rodent models of inflammatory disorders. Here, we examined the effect of apamin on APAP-evoked hepatotoxicity. Intraperitoneal administration of apamin 0.1 mg/kg alleviated histological abnormalities and reduced serum levels of liver enzymes in mice injected with APAP. Apamin inhibited oxidative stress through an increase in the amount of glutathione and activation of the antioxidant system. Apamin also attenuated apoptosis with inhibition of caspase-3 activation. Moreover, apamin reduced serum and hepatic levels of cytokines in APAP-injected mice. These effects were accompanied by suppression of NF-B activation. Furthermore, apamin inhibited chemokine expression and inflammatory cell infiltration. Our results suggest that apamin dampens APAP-evoked hepatotoxicity through inhibiting oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation."
Acetaminophen,COX-2 inhibition,"This double-blind, randomized crossover study assessed the effect of acetaminophen 1000 mg every 8 hours versus indomethacin 50 mg every 8 hours versus placebo on cyclooxygenase enzymes COX-1 and COX-2. Urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1, prostacyclin metabolite, PGI-M COX-2 inhibition and 11-dehydro thromboxane B2 thromboxane metabolite, Tx-M COX-1 inhibition were measured after 1 dose and 5 days of dosing. Peak inhibition of urinary metabolite excretion across 8 hours following dosing was the primary end point. Mean PGI-M excretion was 33.7, 55.9, and 64.6 on day 1 and 49.4, 65.1, and 80.3 on day 5 placebo, acetaminophen, and indomethacin, respectively. Acetaminophen and indomethacin inhibited PGI-M excretion following single and multiple doses P = .004 vs placebo. PGI-M excretion inhibition after 1 dose was similar for indomethacin and acetaminophen, but significantly greater with indomethacin after multiple doses P = .006. Mean Tx-M excretion was 16.2, 45.2, and 86.6 on day 1 and 46.2, 58.4, and 92.6 on day 5 placebo, acetaminophen, and indomethacin, respectively. Tx-M excretion inhibition following 1 dose was reduced by acetaminophen P  .003. Indomethacin reduced Tx-M excretion significantly more than acetaminophen and placebo after single and multiple doses P  .001. Acetaminophen and indomethacin inhibited COX-1 and COX-2 following a single dose, but acetaminophen was a less potent COX-1 inhibitor than indomethacin."
Acetaminophen,caspase-3 activation,"Acetaminophen AAP, a widely used analgesic drug, can damage various organs when taken in large doses. In this study, we investigate whether AAP causes cell damage by altering the early signaling pathways associated with cell death and survival. AAP caused time- and concentration-dependent apoptosis and DNA fragmentation of C6 glioma cells used as a model. AAP activated c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase JNK by 5.3-fold within 15 min. The elevated JNK activity persisted for up to 4 h before it returned to the basal level at 8 h. In contrast, activities of other mitogen-activated protein MAP kinases and the level of Akt phosphorylation in the cell survival pathway remained unchanged throughout the treatment. Wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, or SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, did not reduce AAP-induced toxicity, indicating that these enzymes do not play a major role in cell toxicity. AAP-induced apoptosis was preceded by the sequential elevation of the pro-apoptotic Bax protein, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activity. Treatment with caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone Z-DEVD-FMK significantly reduced AAP-induced caspase-3 activation and cytotoxicity. Transfection of cDNA for the dominant-negative mutant JNK-KR or stress-activated protein kinase kinase-1 Lys--gtArg mutant SEK1-KR, an immediate upstream kinase of JNK, significantly reduced AAP-induced JNK activation and cell death rate. The noncytotoxic analog of AAP, 3-hydroxyacetanilide, neither increased JNK activity nor caused apoptosis. Pretreatment with YH439, an inhibitor of CYP2E1 gene transcription, markedly reduced CYP2E1 mRNA, protein content, and activity, as well as the rate of AAP-induced JNK activation and cell death. These data indicate that AAP can cause cell damage by activating the JNK-related cell death pathway, providing a new mechanism for AAP-induced cytotoxicity."
Acetaminophen,caspase-3 activation,"We reported previously that acetaminophen overdose interrupts the signaling pathway of Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis. The aim of our study was to investigate the mechanism of this effect. Male C3Heb/FeJ mice received a single dose of acetaminophen 300 mg/kg ip and/or anti-Fas antibody Jo-2 0.6 mg/kg iv. Some animals were treated with allopurinol 100 mg/kg po 18 and 1 h before acetaminophen injection. After 90 min of Jo treatment, there was processing of procaspase-3 and a significant increase in liver caspase-3 activity, which is consistent with apoptotic cell death. Treatment with acetaminophen 2.5 h before Jo inhibited the increase in hepatic caspase-3 activity by preventing the processing of the proenzyme. When administered alone, acetaminophen did not induce caspase-3 activation but caused significant liver injury. Acetaminophen treatment alone caused mitochondrial cytochrome c release, depletion of the hepatic ATP content by 55, and a 10-fold increase in mitochondrial glutathione disulfide levels. Pretreatment with allopurinol prevented the mitochondrial oxidant stress and liver injury due to acetaminophen toxicity but had no effect on Jo-mediated apoptosis. Allopurinol did not affect the initial glutathione depletion after acetaminophen. However, allopurinol restored the sensitivity of hepatocytes to Fas receptor signaling in acetaminophen-treated animals. Histochemical evaluation of DNA fragmentation with the TUNEL assay showed that acetaminophen eliminated Fas receptor-mediated apoptosis in all hepatocytes not just in the damaged cells of the centrilobular area. Our data suggest that acetaminophen-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and not the initial glutathione depletion is responsible for the interruption of Fas receptor-mediated apoptotic signaling in hepatocytes."
Acetaminophen,caspase-3 activation,"Murine acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury ALI serves as paradigmatic model for drug-induced hepatic injury and regeneration. As major cause of ALI, acetaminophen overdosing is a persistent therapeutic challenge with N-acetylcysteine clinically used to ameliorate parenchymal necrosis. To identify further treatment strategies that serve patients with poor N-acetylcysteine responses, hepatic 3mRNA sequencing was performed in the initial resolution phase at 24 h/48 h after sublethal overdosing. This approach disclosed 45 genes upregulated 5-fold within this time frame. Focusing on C5aR1, we observed in C5aR1-deficient mice disease aggravation during resolution of intoxication as evidenced by increased liver necrosis and serum alanine aminotransferase. Moreover, decreased hepatocyte compensatory proliferation and increased caspase-3 activation at the surroundings of necrotic cores were detectable in C5aR1-deficient mice. Using a non-hypothesis-driven approach, herein pro-regenerative/-resolving effects of C5aR1 were identified during late acetaminophen-induced ALI. Data concur with protection by the C5a/C5aR1-axis during hepatectomy and emphasize the complex role of inflammation during hepatic regeneration and repair."
Acrylamide,EGFR signaling pathway,"The discovery of activating mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR has resulted in the development of more effective treatments for non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC. Although first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors EGFR TKIs provide significant clinical benefit, acquired resistance often occurs, most commonly gt50  via a T790 M resistance mutation. Although AZD9291 is selective for both T790 M and activating EGFR mutations over wild-type EGFR, it is highly active when T790 M is present, especially EGFRL858R/T790M, and modestly active when T790 M is absent. The aim of this study was to elucidate the underlying mechanism of the high sensitivity of NSCLC cells harboring EGFRL858R/T790M to AZD9291. In H1975 cells harboring EGFRL858R/T790M, AZD9291 potently inhibited cellular growth and EGFR signaling pathways together with depletion of mutant EGFR protein. AZD9291-induced depletion of EGFRL858R/T790M protein was abrogated through inhibition of the proteasome with MG132. However, AZD9291 had no effect on protein levels of EGFRWT and EGFRL858R. In addition, AZD9291 induced apoptosis and caused expression changes in cell cycle-related genes. Moreover, oral administration of AZD9291 as a single agent induced tumor regression in vivo in a H1975 tumor xenograft model and reduced EGFRL858R/T790M protein levels in xenograft tumors. Taken together, our results provide a potential mechanism for the sensitivity of EGFRL858R/T790M cells to AZD9291 and suggest that AZD9291 may be effective in cases of T790 M-positive EGFR resistance."
Acrylamide,caspase-3 activation,"Gallic acid GA is a natural anti-cancer compound that can be found in many food sources, including edible mushrooms, fruits, and vegetables. Studies generally attribute the anti-cancer activity of GA to the induction of apoptosis. Here, we reported that GA activated iron-dependent cell death mechanisms with apoptotic, ferroptotic, and necroptotic features. Our time-lapse live-cell microscopy study demonstrated that GA could induce coexistence of multiple types of cell death pathways, including apoptosis characterized by mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation, ferroptosis characterized by lipid peroxidation, and necroptosis characterized by the loss of plasma membrane integrity. This GA-induced cell death could be completely suppressed by exposure to an iron chelator deferoxamine, indicating that it is an iron-dependent cell death process. Importantly, MLKL mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein inhibitor necrosulfonamide exerted a synergistic effect by increasing the sensitivity of cancer cells to GA. Taken together, our results provide new mechanistic insights, and also suggest new strategies to enhance the efficacy of this natural anti-cancer compound by identifying the agents that can promote or suppress the GA-induced cell death process."
Acrylamide,EGFR signaling pathway,"In this paper, we described the synthesis and cytotoxic activities of two new series of thieno2,3-dpyrimidine and thieno3,2-d pyrimidine derivatives. Most of the synthesized compounds had significant antiproliferative activities against PC3, MDA-MB-231, A549, and HeLa cell lines in comparison to the reference drug, erlotinib. Compounds N-4-3,5-dichlorophenylaminothieno2,3-dpyrimidin-6-ylcinnamamide 8e and E-N-4-3,4-dichlorophenylaminothieno2,3-dpyrimidin-6-yl-3-4-methoxyphenylacrylamide 8g with IC50 values of 4 nM and 33 nM, respectively, against HeLa cell line were chosen for further studies. The apoptosis induced activity and cell cycle arrest were determined and the results provided evidence that these compounds induced cell death via apoptosis and arrested cell growth in sub-G1 phase. In addition, western blot analysis manifested the promising result of suppressing the EGFR signaling pathway p-EGFR/p-ERK1/2. The docking studies appreciated the considerable potency of compound 8e based on hydrogen and covalent binding interactions. Eventually, in silico pharmacokinetic prediction indicated the acceptable bioavailability of all final compounds."
Acrylamide,EGFR signaling pathway,"INTRODUCTION Osimertinib is an oral, potent, irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor TKI selective for EGFR TKI and T790M resistance mutations. To enhance understanding of osimertinibs mechanism of action, we aimed to evaluate the modulation of key molecular biomarkers after osimertinib treatment in paired clinical samples from the phase I AURA trial.   METHODS Paired tumor biopsy samples were collected before the study and after 15 plus or minus 7 days of osimertinib treatment 80 or 160 mg daily. Clinical efficacy outcomes were assessed according to whether viable paired biopsy samples could be collected safety was also assessed. Immunohistochemical analyses assessed key pathway and tumor/immune-relevant markers phospho-EGFR, phospho-S6, phospho-AKT, programmed death ligand 1, and CD8, with samples scored by image analysis or a pathologist blinded to treatment allocation.   RESULTS Predose tumor biopsy samples were collected from 61 patients with EGFR T790M tumors 29 patients had no viable postdose biopsy sample because of tumor regression or insufficient tumor sample. Evaluable predose and postdose tumor biopsy samples were collected from 24 patients. Objective response rate ORR and median progression-free survival mPFS were improved in patients from whom a postdose biopsy sample could not be collected ORR 62 and mPFS 9.7 months p = 0.027 compared with those from whom paired samples were collected ORR 29 and mPFS 6.6 months. Osimertinib modulated key EGFR signaling pathways and led to increased immune cell infiltration.   CONCLUSIONS Collection of paired biopsy samples was challenging because of rapid tumor regression after osimertinib treatment, highlighting the difficulties of performing on-study biopsies in patients treated with highly active drugs."
Acrylamide,caspase-3 activation,"We previously identified the intracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase iNAMPT, aka pre-B-cell colony enhancing factor as a candidate gene promoting acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS and ventilator-induced lung injury VILI with circulating nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase potently inducing NF-B signaling in lung endothelium. iNAMPT also synthesizes intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide iNAD in response to extracellular oxidative stress, contributing to the inhibition of apoptosis via ill-defined mechanisms. We now further define the role of iNAMPT activity in the pathogenesis of ARDS/VILI using the selective iNAMPT inhibitor FK-866. C57/B6 mice were exposed to VILI 40 ml/kg, 4 h or LPS 1.5 mg/kg, 18 h after osmotic pump delivery of FK-866 100 mg/kg/d, intraperitoneally. Assessment of total bronchoalveolar lavage BAL protein, polymorphonuclear neutrophil PMN levels, cytokine levels TNF-, IL-6, IL-1, lung iNAD levels, and injury scores revealed that FK-866-mediated iNAMPT inhibition successfully reduced lung tissue iNAD levels, BAL injury indices, inflammatory cell infiltration, and lung injury scores in LPS- and VILI-exposed mice. FK-866 further increased lung PMN apoptosis, as reflected by caspase-3 activation in BAL PMNs. These findings support iNAMPT inhibition via FK-866 as a novel therapeutic agent for ARDS via enhanced apoptosis in inflammatory PMNs."
Acrylamide,caspase-3 activation,"In an attempt to develop potent anticancer agents, a series of 2-anilinonicotinyl-linked acrylamide conjugates were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for cytotoxic activity against various human cancer cell lines, anti-tubulin activity and cell-cycle effects. Among the series, compounds 6 d E-N-6-fluorobenzodthiazol-2-yl-3-2-3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylaminopyridin-3-ylacrylamide and 6 p E-3-2-4-methoxyphenylaminopyridin-3-yl-N-6-nitrobenzodthiazol-2-ylacrylamide showed promising cytotoxicity, specifically against the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line, with GI50 values of 0.60.23 and 1.80.22 M, respectively. Furthermore, cell-cycle perturbation studies by flow cytometry analysis indicated drastic cell-cycle effects in the G2 /M phase in this cell line followed by caspase-3 activation and apoptotic cell death. Molecular docking studies of the most potent compound, 6 d, revealed that this compound interacts with and binds efficiently in the active site of tubulin."
Acrylamide,EGFR signaling pathway,"The importance of the EGF receptor EGFR signaling pathway in the development and progression of nonsmall cell lung carcinomas NSCLC is widely recognized. Gene sequencing studies revealed that a majority of tumors responding to EGFR kinase inhibitors harbor activating mutations in the EGFR kinase domain. This underscores the need for novel biomarkers and diagnostic imaging approaches to identify patients who may benefit from particular therapeutic agents and approaches with improved efficacy and safety profiles. To this goal, we developed 4-3-iodophenylamino-7-2-2-2-2-2-2-18Ffluoroethoxy-ethoxy-ethoxy-ethoxy-ethoxy-ethoxy-quinazoline-6-yl-acrylamide 18FF-PEG6-IPQA, a radiotracer with increased selectivity and irreversible binding to the active mutant L858R EGFR kinase. We show that PET with 18FF-PEG6-IPQA in tumor-bearing mice discriminates H3255 NSCLC xenografts expressing L858R mutant EGFR from H441 and PC14 xenografts expressing EGFR or H1975 xenografts with L858R/T790M dual mutation in EGFR kinase domain, which confers resistance to EGFR inhibitors i.e., gefitinib. The T790M mutation precludes the 18FF-PEG6-IPQA from irreversible binding to EGFR. These results suggest that PET with 18FF-PEG6-IPQA could be used for the selection of NSCLC patients for individualized therapy with small molecular inhibitors of EGFR kinase that are currently used in the clinic and have a similar structure i.e., iressa, gefitinib, and erlotinib."
Acrylamide,EGFR signaling pathway,"Epigenetic mutations are closely associated with human diseases, especially cancers. Among them, dysregulations of histone deacetylases HDACs are commonly observed in human cancers. Recent years, HDAC inhibitors have been identified as promising anticancer agents several HDAC inhibitors have been applied in clinical practice. In this study, we synthesized a novel N-hydroxyacrylamide-derived HDAC inhibitor, I-7ab, and examined its antitumor activity. Our investigations demonstrated that I-7ab exerted cytotoxicity toward and inhibited the growth of human cancer cell lines at micromolar concentrations. Among tested cells, HCT116 was the most sensitive one to the treatment of I-7ab. However, I-7ab displayed far less cytotoxicity in human normal cells. In HCT116 cells, I-7ab inhibited the expression of class I HDACs, especially that of HDAC3, and suppressed EGFR signaling pathway. With respect to the cytotoxic effect of I-7ab, it induced apoptosis via increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and suppressing the translocation of NF-B. Other than inducing apoptosis, I-7ab inhibited the expression of cyclin B1 and thereby arrests cell cycle progression at G2/M phase. Further analyses revealed potential role of p53 and p21 in I-7ab-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. According to our findings, I-7ab may serve as a lead compound for potential antitumor drugs."
Acrylamide,EGFR signaling pathway,"PURPOSE Histone deacetylase 3 HDAC3 has been suggested to play a role in hepatocellular carcinoma HCC. In the present report, we aimed to identify the effects of RGFP966, a specific HDAC3 inhibitor, on the cell proliferation and migration of HCC cell lines.   METHODS Human HCC cell lines, which were identified using short tandem repeat STR DNA profiling analysis, were used in this report. Cell proliferation assay was used to identify the growth viability of cells. Wound healing and transwell assay were used to identify the migration ability of cells. Further, a human phospho-receptor tyrosine kinases array kit was used to screen out RGFP966 effects on key receptor tyrosine kinases. Then, the mRNA expression was quantified by real-time PCR, and protein expression was identified by Western blot immunoassay.   RESULTS We found that RGFP966 inhibited both proliferation and migration of HCC cells. Further, RGFP966 represses the expression and phosphorylation levels of epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR in HCC cells. Moreover, HDAC3 is involved in the inhibition of EGFR by RGFP966. Overall, we elucidated an inhibitive function of RGFP966 in HCC progression.   CONCLUSION RGFP966 inhibits EGFR signaling pathway and suppresses proliferation and migration of HCC cells."
Amiodarone,caspase-3 activation,"The continuous shortage of organs necessitates the use of marginal organs from donors with various diseases, including arrhythmia-associated cardiac failure. One of the most frequently used anti-arrhythmic drugs is amiodarone AM, which is given in particular in emergency situations. Apart from its anti-arrhythmic actions, AM provides anti-oxidative properties in cardiomyocytes. Thus, we were interested in whether AM donor pretreatment affects the organ quality and function of livers procured for preservation and transplantation. Donor rats were pretreated with AM 5 mg/kg of body weight 10 minutes before flush-out of the liver with a cold 4 degrees C histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution n = 8. Livers were then stored for 24 hours at 4 degrees C before ex situ reperfusion with a 37 degrees C Krebs-Henseleit solution for 60 minutes in a nonrecirculating system. At the end of reperfusion, tissue samples were taken for histology and Western blot analysis. Animals with vehicle only 0.9 NaCl served as ischemia/reperfusion controls n = 8. Additionally, livers of untreated animals n = 8 not subjected to 24 hours of cold ischemia served as sham controls. AM pretreatment effectively attenuated lipid peroxidation, stress protein expression, and apoptotic cell death. This was indicated by an AM-mediated reduction of malondialdehyde, heme oxygenase-1, and caspase-3 activation. However, AM treatment also induced mitochondrial damage and hepatocellular excretory dysfunction, as indicated by a significantly increased glutamate dehydrogenase concentration in the effluate and decreased bile production. In conclusion, AM donor pretreatment exerts anti-oxidative actions in liver preservation and reperfusion. However, these protective AM actions are counteracted by an induction of mitochondrial damage and hepatocellular dysfunction. Accordingly, AM pretreatment of donors for anti-arrhythmic therapy should be performed with caution."
Amiodarone,L-type calcium channel blockade,"INTRODUCTION The mechanisms whereby dronedarone reduces sinus rate are not well understood, although L-type calcium channel antagonism, beta-adrenergic blockade, and inhibition of If are plausible.   METHODS AND RESULTS In anesthetized pigs, we compared the effects of dronedarone to the prototypical If inhibitor, ivabradine, and the L-type calcium channel antagonist diltiazem on heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure MAP, and contractility. Dronedarones effects on the phenylephrine-induced rise in MAP and on the chronotropic response to isoproterenol were also investigated. Cumulative doses of dronedarone 0.5 mg/kg, i.v., and 5.0 mg/kg, i.v. plasma level 80  16.1 nM progressively reduced heart rate P lt 0.02 without changes in MAP or contractility as assessed by LV dP/dt N = 6. Ivabradine 0.5 mg/kg, i.v. similarly reduced heart rate P lt 0.01 without change in MAP N = 6. Diltiazem 0.8 mg/kg, i.v. reduced heart rate and MAP and decreased contractility N = 6. Dronedarone blunted phenylephrines alpha-receptor-mediated increase in MAP but did not alter the marked beta-adrenergic receptor BAR-mediated increase in heart rate induced by isoproterenol. When dronedarone injection was preceded by ivabradine, no further decrease in heart rate or change in MAP was observed N = 6.   CONCLUSIONS Dronedarone reduced heart rate without affecting MAP or contractility, effects that differ from L-type calcium channel blockade. Dronedarone did not antagonize BAR stimulation, and its heart-rate lowering effects were eliminated by prior administration of ivabradine. Thus, dronedarones bradycardic action is likely due to inhibition of If and not to blockade of either L-type calcium channels or BAR."
Amiodarone,caspase-3 activation,"Bladder cancer BC is a common malignancy of the urinary tract that has a higher frequency in men than in women. Cytostatic resistance and metastasis formation are significant risk factors in BC therapy therefore, there is great interest in overcoming drug resistance and in initiating research for novel chemotherapeutic approaches. Here, we suggest that desethylamiodarone DEA-a metabolite of amiodarone-may have cytostatic potential. DEA activates the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential detected by JC-1 fluorescence, and induces cell death in T24 human transitional-cell bladder carcinoma cell line at physiologically achievable concentrations. DEA induces cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, which may contribute to the inhibition of cell proliferation, and shifts the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio to initiate apoptosis, induce AIF nuclear translocation, and activate PARP-1 cleavage and caspase-3 activation. The major cytoprotective kinases-ERK and Akt-are inhibited by DEA, which may contribute to its cell death-inducing effects. DEA also inhibits the expression of B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 BMI1 and reduces colony formation of T24 bladder carcinoma cells, indicating its possible inhibitory effect on metastatic potential. These data show that DEA is a novel anti-cancer candidate of multiple cell death-inducing effects and metastatic potential. Our findings recommend further evaluation of its effects in clinical studies."

Atrazine,AChE inhibition,"Biomarkers are widely used to assess pesticide stress, but their ecological relevance and exposure time dependent sensitivity is still heavily debated. We studied both aspects in larvae of the damselfly Coenagrion puella, comparing the impact of low doses of atrazine, carbaryl, and endosulfan on two key biomarkers acetylcholinesterase AChE activity and fluctuating asymmetry FA and their relationship with life history traits mortality, development time, growth rate, and body size. Larvae exposed to the pesticides had, in general, longer development times. Size, growth rate, and mortality were not affected by any of the pesticides. In the long-term exposure, AChE activity was diminished by atrazine treatments and stimulated by carbaryl treatments, and was not affected in the endosulfan treatments. FA decreased with increasing endosulfan concentrations and showed no reaction to atrazine or carbaryl. Overall, short-term exposure tended to overestimate the results of long-term exposure decreasing growth rates and enhancing inhibition of AChE activity in atrazine and carbaryl treatments. In line with its ecological relevance, relationship between biomarkers and life history traits showed that AChE inhibition was positively correlated with mortality, while FA was traded off with size. These results show that caution should be exerted when using these biomarkers to assess pesticide pollution in field situations."
Atrazine,AChE inhibition,"From April 1997 to June 1998, 14 measurements of acetylcholinesterase AChE enzymatic activity were performed with the copepod, Tigriopus brevicornis, collected at five stations in the Vilaine River estuary South Brittany, France. Simultaneously, four chemical analyses of triazines and one analysis of total pesticides in water were undertaken. AChE activity levels in T. brevicornis were compared to the levels measured at a reference site not exposed to effluents from Vilaine River. Results reveal significant differences between AChE activity levels depending on location of stations in the plume of the river with an increasing gradient of activity from the upstream to the downstream stations, thus indicating that neurotoxic contaminants are mainly brought by the river. The average degree of AChE inhibition between the reference site and the most upstream site is 70-80 during spring in 1997 and 1998. In May 1997, live copepods from the different sites were brought back and transferred to clean seawater. After 14 days, recovery of AChE activity was almost total when compared to the control. Moreover, using a linear regression model and the atrazine concentration as marker of the presence of pesticides, low levels of AChE activity were significantly explained by atrazine concentration in water."

Bisphenol A,PPARgamma activation,"BACKGROUND amp AIMS The ligand-dependent transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma PPARgamma is expressed in hepatic stellate cells HSC, and its transcriptional activity is reduced during cell transdifferentiation in culture. PPARgamma transcriptional activation decreases platelet-derived growth factor-induced proliferation and inhibits alpha-smooth muscle actin expression in cultured HSC. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether oral administration of synthetic PPARgamma ligands, thiazolidinediones TZD, might affect collagen deposition in animal models of liver fibrosis.   METHODS The effect of 2 TZD pioglitazone or rosiglitazone was tested on liver fibrosis induced in rats by either toxin administration dimethylnitrosamine or carbon tetrachloride or bile duct ligation. In vivo PPARgamma activation was evaluated by gel shift assay using nuclear extracts from HSC isolated from control and treated rats.   RESULTS Oral administration of TZD reduced extracellular matrix deposition and HSC activation in both toxic and cholestatic models of liver fibrosis. PPARgamma-specific DNA binding was significantly impaired in nuclear extracts of HSC isolated from fibrotic rats compared with HSC from control rats. TZD administration restored PPARgamma DNA binding in HSC nuclei. In vitro, TZD-induced PPARgamma activation inhibited collagen and fibronectin synthesis induced by transforming growth factor TGF-beta1 in human HSC, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Northen blotting. TZD also reduced the TGF-beta1-induced activity of a 3.5-kilobase procollagen type I promoter transfected in human HSC.   CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that PPARgamma activation in HSC retards fibrosis in vivo and suggest the use of TZD for the treatment of liver fibrosis."
Bisphenol A,PPARgamma activation,"Treatment of U937 cells with mono2-ethylhexylphthalate MEHP for 20 h led to a dose-dependent loss of cell viability, assessed by propidium iodide PI staining with fluorescent activated cell sorting FACS analysis. The cytotoxic behavior of MEHP is attributed to the induction of apoptosis. MEHP induced activation of caspase-3, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and the morphological features of nuclear apoptosis. Analysis with LightCycler quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated the decrease of bcl-2 and increase of bax mRNA levels. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPAR gamma antagonists, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether BADGE and GW9662, significantly inhibited the MEHP-induced caspase-3 activity and apoptotic nuclear morphological changes. Furthermore, a PPARgamma ligand, rosiglitazone synergized the MEHP-induced caspase-3 activity. These results suggest that MEHP can induce apoptosis in U937 cells through modulation of the balance of bcl-2/bax in part by PPARgamma activation."
Bisphenol A,caspase-3 activation,"We examined whether bisphenol A BPA and 4-nonylphenol NP influenced staurosporine-induced neuronal cell death in primary cultured rat hippocampal and cortical neurons. In hippocampal neurons, 17beta-estradiol E2 1 nM and 10 microM and BPA 10 microM significantly inhibited the staurosporine-induced release of lactate dehydrogenase LDH. In cortical neurons, BPA significantly inhibited the LDH release, while E2 did not. In hippocampal neurons, E2 and BPA significantly inhibited the staurosporine-induced increase in caspase-3 activity. In cortical neurons, BPA and NP significantly inhibited the increase in caspase-3 activity, while E2 did not. Furthermore, low-dose BPA 10 nM also significantly inhibited the increase in caspase-3 activity in both hippocampal and cortical neurons. BPA and NP might impede normal brain development by inhibiting even desirable neuronal cell death, interfering with caspase-3 activation."

Rosiglitazone decreased systolic 138/-5 versus 128/-5 mm Hg and mean blood pressure 145/-5 versus 126/-7 mm Hg of RA mice as measured by tail-cuff and indwelling carotid catheters, respectively. Relaxation of carotid arteries to acetylcholine and authentic nitric oxide, but not papaverine, was impaired in RA mice when compared with littermate controls RA-. There were no effects of rosiglitazone on RA- mice however, relaxation to acetylcholine 49/-10 versus 82/-9 at 100 micromol/L and nitric oxide 51/-11 versus 72/-6 at 10 micromol/L was significantly improved in treated RA mice. Rosiglitazone treatment of RA mice did not alter the expression of genes, including endothelial nitric oxide synthase eNOS, angiotensin 1 receptors, and preproendothelin-1, nor did it alter the levels of eNOS or soluble guanylyl cyclase protein. In separate studies, carotid arteries from RA and RA- mice relaxed in a concentration-dependent manner to rosiglitazone, suggesting possible PPARgamma-independent effects in the vasculature. This response was not inhibited with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor Nomega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester 200 micromol/L or the PPARgamma antagonist bisphenol A diglycidyl ether 4,4-isopropylidenediphenol diglycidyl ether 100 micromol/L. These data suggest that in addition to potential genomic regulation caused by PPARgamma activation, the direct effect of rosiglitazone in blood vessels may contribute to the improved blood pressure and vessel function."
Bisphenol A,caspase-3 activation,"Bisphenol A 2,2-bis4-hydroxyphenyl propane, BPA is a well-known endocrine-disrupting compound that is widely used in various daily products and exhibits embryonic development toxicity and genotoxicity. However, the affected signaling pathways involved in embryonic development especially the interactions of involved proteins remain unclear. In our previous study Ge et al., 2021, BPA induces DNA damage and apoptosis in Xenopus embryos, resulting in multiple malformations of larvae. However, the signaling pathways induced for apoptosis response to DNA damage are still not well elucidated. Here, we systematically elucidated the enriched pathways affected by BPA and illustrated the interactions of involved proteins. Results indicated that BPA affected multiple embryonic development pathways including Hippo, TGF-, Wnt, and Notch pathways. Furthermore, the protein-protein interaction network suggested that the c-Abl/YAPY357/p73 pathway may play a key role in apoptosis induction in response to DNA damage. P19 embryonal carcinoma stem cells, as a developmental toxicity model, were treated with different BPA concentrations to establish an in vitro model to verify the role of the c-Abl/YAPY357/p73 pathway in apoptosis. BPA triggered DNA damage and significantly upregulated the expression levels of c-Abl, phosphorylated YAPY357, phosphorylated p73Y99, and cleaved caspase-3 protein p lt 0.05, thus decreasing cell viability and transcriptionally activating the p73 target genes Bax and Puma. These data suggested that BPA activated the c-Abl/YAPY357/p73 pathway in response to DNA damage. Imatinib, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase c-Abl, significantly downregulated the elevated expression levels of p-YAPY357, p-p73Y99 and cleaved caspase-3 p lt 0.05 caused by BPA and then ameliorated the cell index of P19 cells in the BPA-treated group. Therefore, this substance restrained the phosphokinase activity of c-Abl and suppressed the c-Abl/YAPY357/p73 pathway. Results showed that the c-Abl/YAPY357/p73 pathway served as a mechanism for caspase-3 activation that induced the apoptosis response to DNA damage stress."
Bisphenol A,caspase-3 activation,"Our study aimed to elucidate to what extent Ginkgo biloba Gb can protect rats from cognitive deficits induced by exposure to Bisphenol A BPA at high dose. Therefore, sixty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups of 15 animals in each group Vehicle group, Gb-control group, BPA-exposed group and Gb pre-treated group. All administrations were given daily by an oral gavage once a day for eight weeks. Cognitive function was assessed using Morris water maze Y-maze and Novel object recognition tasks. Additionally, hippocampal levels of DA, NE and 5-HT were measured. BPA-induced oxidative stress was evaluated by determining SOD activity, NO and MDA levels in rat hippocampus as well as level of circulating adiponectin. Moreover, histopathological changes in CA3 region of rat hippocampus and immunohistochemical expression of NF-B and Caspase-3 were investigated. We found that Gb pretreatment significantly improved cognitive performance may be via increasing hippocampal levels of estrogen-dependent biogenic amines. At the same time, Gb could strictly control BPA-induced oxidative stress by improving SOD activity and adiponectin level with decrease in NO and MDA levels. Lastly, Gb alleviated the histopathological injuries induced by BPA and inhibited NF-B and caspase-3 activation. In conclusion, our results suggested that Gb has potential to ameliorate BPA-induced hippocampal neuronal damage and subsequent cognitive deficits through mechanisms involving its ability to enhance the release of biogenic amines as well as its antioxidant and adiponectin pro-secretory effects."
Bisphenol A,caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Bisphenol A BPA, a reprotoxic and endocrine-disrupting chemical, has been substituted by alternative bisphenols such as bisphenol F BPF and bisphenol S BPS in the plastic industry. Despite their detection in placenta and amniotic fluids, the effects of bisphenols on human placental cells have not been characterized. Our objective was to explore in vitro and to compare the toxicity of BPA to its substitutes BPF and BPS to highlight their potential risks for placenta and then pregnancy.   METHODS Human placenta cells JEG-Tox cells were incubated with BPA, BPF, and BPS for 72 h. Cell viability, cell death, and degenerative P2X7 receptor and caspases activation, and chromatin condensation were assessed using microplate cytometry and fluorescence microscopy.   RESULTS Incubation with BPA, BPF, or BPS was associated with P2X7 receptor activation and chromatin condensation. BPA and BPF induced more caspase-1, caspase-9, and caspase-3 activation than BPS. Only BPF enhanced caspase-8 activity.   CONCLUSIONS BPA, BPF, and BPS are all toxic to human placental cells, with the P2X7 receptor being a common key element. BPA substitution by BPF and BPS does not appear to be a safe alternative for human health, particularly for pregnant women and their fetuses."
Bisphenol A,PPARgamma activation,"Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors PPARs are nuclear transcription factors of the steroid receptor super-family. One member, PPARgamma, a critical transcription factor in adipogenesis, is expressed in ECV304 cells, and when activated participates in the induction of cell death by apoptosis. Here we describe a clone of ECV304 cells, ECV-ACO.Luc, which stably expresses a reporter gene for PPAR activation. ECV-ACO.Luc respond to the PPARgamma agonists, 15-deoxy-Delta12,14 PGJ2, and ciglitizone, by inducing luciferase expression. Furthermore, using ECV-ACO.Luc, we demonstrate that a newly described PPARgamma antagonist, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether BADGE has agonist activities. Similar to 15-deoxy-Delta12,14 PGJ2, BADGE induces PPARgamma activation, nuclear localization of the receptor, and induces cell death."
Bisphenol A,PPARgamma activation,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPAR-gamma ligands have been shown to inhibit human lung cancers by inducing apoptosis and differentiation. In the present study, we elucidated the apoptotic mechanism of PPARgamma activation in human lung cancers by using a novel PPARgamma agonist, 1-trans-methylimino-N-oxy-6-2-morpholinoethoxy-3-phenyl-1H-indene-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester KR-62980, and rosiglitazone. PPARgamma activation selectively inhibited cell viability of non-small-cell lung cancer with little effect on small-cell lung cancer and normal lung cells. The cell death induced by PPARgamma activation presented apoptotic features of oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation in A549 human non-small-cell lung cancer cell line. Reactive oxygen species ROS production was accompanied by increased expression of proline oxidase POX, a redox enzyme expressed in mitochondria, upon incubation with the agonists. POX RNA interference treatment blocked PPARgamma-induced ROS formation and cytotoxicity, suggesting that POX plays a functional role in apoptosis through ROS formation. The apoptotic effects by the agonists were antagonized by bisphenol A diglycidyl ether, a PPARgamma antagonist, and by knockdown of PPARgamma expression, indicating the involvement of PPARgamma in these actions. The results of the present study suggest that PPARgamma activation induces apoptotic cell death in non-small-cell lung carcinoma mainly through ROS formation via POX induction."
Bisphenol A,caspase-3 activation,"As bisphenol A BPA exerts oxidative/pro-apoptotic effects in several cell types, we explored whether the in vitro exposure to BPA could affect human sperm integrity through the induction of pro-oxidative/apoptotic mitochondrial dysfunction. The exposure of motile sperm suspensions to scalar BPA concentrations for 4h produced a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential, starting from 300M. It was associated with an increased mitochondrial generation of superoxide anion, caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation and motility decrement. Vitality decline was observed at BPA400M. Twenty hours exposure to 300M BPA, but not to lower concentrations, produced a significant loss in sperm vitality associated with a complete sperm immobilization. Finally, 300M BPA also produced a significant DNA oxidative damage, as revealed by the formation of oxidized base adduct 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine. In conclusion, BPA affected human sperm integrity by inducing pro-oxidative/apoptotic mitochondrial dysfunction."
Caffeine,caspase-3 activation,"In the present study, it was investigated whether 1,2-bis2-aminophenoxyethane-N,N,NN-tetraacetic acid BAPTA-AM, an intracellular Ca2 chelator, possesses protective effect against caffeine-induced apoptosis in the central nervous system. Through morphological and biochemical analyses, cells treated with caffeine exhibited several apoptotic features. On the other hand, cells treated with caffeine and BAPTA-AM, showed decreased occurrence of apoptotic features. In addition, it was shown that BAPTA-AM treatment inhibits caffeine-induced increase of caspase-3 enzyme activity. These results show that caffeine induces apoptotic death in human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells and BAPTA-AM prevents apoptosis by attenuating caffeine-induced caspase-3 activation."
Caffeine,AChE inhibition,"This study gives new insights to understand the type of interactions between Ginkgo biloba L. and Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, two Chinese medicinal plants with well documented neuroprotective effects, on three targets in Alzheimers disease AD acetylcholinesterase AChE and butyrylcholnesterase BuChE inhibition and hydrogen peroxide scavenging. Individual samples, binary mixtures with different proportions of both plant species, and also a commercial multicomponent combination containing both plants together with unroasted Coffea arabica L. and quercetin-3-O-rutinoside were used to perform this in vitro evaluation. Sample phenolic profiles were also determined by HPLC-DAD, showing the presence of several flavonoid glycosides, phenolic acids and a methylxanthine. In order to investigate the possible synergism/antagonism interaction, data obtained were analyzed by CompuSyn software. The results showed that G. biloba and S. baicalensis alone display better activities than in mixtures, most of the interactions exhibiting different degrees of antagonism. A slight synergism interaction was only observed for the commercial multicomponent mixture tested against H2O2. Further analysis was carried out to understand which compounds could be responsible for the antagonistic interaction. Seventeen single pure compounds present in all extracts were tested against AChE inhibition, most of them displaying weak or no activity. Only caffeine had a remarkable activity. Five different binary and quaternary mixture compositions were design to deepen the interaction between these compounds, revealing mainly phenolic acid-flavonoid, flavonoid-flavonoid and methylxanthine-flavonoid-phenolic acid antagonistic interactions. These results clearly show that, for the targets evaluated, there is no potentiation of the neuroprotective effect by combining S. baicalensis and G. biloba extracts."
Caffeine,caspase-3 activation,"Huntingtin is a caspase substrate, and loss of normal huntingtin function resulting from caspase-mediated proteolysis may play a role in the pathogenesis of Huntington disease. Here we tested the hypothesis that increasing huntingtin levels protect striatal neurons from NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. Cultured striatal neurons from yeast artificial chromosome YAC18 transgenic mice over-expressing full-length wild-type huntingtin were dramatically protected from apoptosis and caspase-3 activation compared with cultured striatal neurons from non-transgenic FVB/N littermates and YAC72 mice expressing mutant human huntingtin. NMDA receptor activation induced by intrastriatal injection of quinolinic acid initiated a form of apoptotic neurodegeneration within the striatum of mice that was associated with caspase-3 cleavage of huntingtin in neurons and astrocytes, decreased levels of full-length huntingtin, and the generation of a specific N-terminal caspase cleavage product of huntingtin. In vivo, over-expression of wild-type huntingtin in YAC18 transgenic mice conferred significant protection against NMDA receptor-mediated apoptotic neurodegeneration. These data provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that huntingtin may regulate the balance between neuronal survival and death following acute excitotoxic stress, and that the levels of huntingtin may modulate neuronal sensitivity to excitotoxic neurodegeneration. We suggest that further study of huntingtins anti-apoptotic function will contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of Huntingdons disease and provide insights into the selective vulnerability of striatal neurons to excitotoxic cell death."
Caffeine,caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Pseudorabies virus PRV infection induces apoptosis in swine cells both in vitro and in vivo however, the mechanism associated with host-cell signaling has not been studied. This study investigated the role of free radicals caused by cellular oxidative stress after viral infection and examined whether the DNA damage response plays an important role in PRV-induced apoptosis.   METHODS Several apoptosis assays and western blotting confirmed PRV-induced apoptosis. PRV-mediated oxidative stress was evaluated by reactive oxygen species ROS assay.   RESULTS Our results showed that PRV caused apoptosis in a porcine kidney cell line, PK15, and induced expressions of proapoptotic Bcl family proteins in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Expressions of specific DNA damage sensors and phosphorylation of histone H2AX were also significantly increased, which subsequently activated the expressions of checkpoint kinase 1/2 and proapoptotic p53. Caffeine, a known DNA damage inhibitor, was found to inhibit caspase-3 activation and protect cells from PRV-induced apoptosis. Additionally, the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine was shown to prevent the production of cellular ROS, protecting DNA from cleavage.   CONCLUSIONS Our results confirmed that oxidative stress and free radicals arising from PRV infection cause DNA damage, which consequently triggers apoptosis."
Caffeine,caspase-3 activation,"Sorcin localizes in cellular membranes and has been demonstrated to modulate cytosolic Ca2 handling in cardiac myocytes. Sorcin also localizes in mitochondria however, the effect of sorcin on mitochondrial Ca2 handling is unknown. Using mitochondrial pericam, we measured mitochondrial Ca2 concentration and fluxes in intact neonatal cardiac myocytes overexpressing sorcin. Our results showed that sorcin increases basal and caffeine-stimulated mitochondrial Ca2 concentration. This effect was associated with faster Ca2 uptake and release. The effect of sorcin was specific for mitochondria, since similar results were obtained with digitonin-permeabilized cells, where cytosolic Ca2 flux was disrupted. Furthermore, mitochondria of cardiac myocytes in which sorcin was overexpressed were more Ca2-tolerant. Experiments analyzing apoptotic signaling demonstrated that sorcin prevented 2-deoxyglucose-induced cytochrome c release. Furthermore, sorcin prevented hyperglycemia-induced cytochrome c release and caspase activation. In contrast, antisense sorcin induced caspase-3 activation. Thus, sorcin antiapoptotic properties may be due to modulation of mitochondrial Ca2 handling in cardiac myocytes."
Caffeine,caspase-3 activation,"Methamphetamine METH is a highly addictive CNS stimulant that its long-term use is associated with the loss of neurons in substantia nigra and development of Parkinsons disease later in life. Common form of METH is Ya-Ba tablet, in which, large portion of caffeine is added to the mass to enhance the stimulatory effect. Previous study demonstrated that caffeine potentiates the toxic effect of METH in association with the production of reactive oxygen species and the induction of apoptosis. Since METH causes induction of autophagy, the question was raised whether this pathway participates in the potentiating effect of caffeine on METH neurotoxicity. We used SH-SY5Y, a neuroblastoma cell line, as an in vitro model to study the effect of METH and caffeine. Co-treatment of non-toxic concentrations of METH, at 0.5 mM, and caffeine, at 1 mM, caused reduction of the cell viability. Reduction of the cell viability was associated with attenuation of autophagy, demonstrated by reduction of LC3-II levels and the number of autophagosome puncta, together with increase of caspase-3 activation. Similar effect was produced by treatment with autophagy inhibitors, 3-MA and wortmanin. Our results suggested that caffeine potentiates METH toxicity through inhibition of autophagy and that autophagy serves as a protective mechanism. In conclusion, we proposed the augmented hazard associated with caffeine and METH combination in Ya-Ba abusers."
Caffeine,AChE inhibition,"Natural products have significantly contributed to drug discovery for neurodegenerative diseases. Caffeine is one of the well-known central nervous systemCNS-active natural products. Besides its CNS stimulant properties, it is a mild inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase AChE and possesses memory-enhancing properties. The present work aimed to improve the AChE inhibition activity of the caffeine. The rationally designed caffeine-based triazoles were synthesized and evaluated in vitro for cholinesterase and -site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 BACE-1 inhibitory activities. The attachment of triazole to the caffeine enhances its AChE inhibition activity from half-maximal inhibitory concentration IC50 of 129 M to 0.49 M derivative, 6l. The caffeine core interacts with the peripheral anionic site, whereas the benzyl triazole occupies the catalytic anionic site located at the bottom of the active site gorge. The structure-activity relationship revealed that the four-atom ester linker is superior to shorter linkers for connecting the caffeine core to the triazole. The 2,6-difluorobenzyl triazole-linked caffeine derivative, 6d, exhibits dual inhibition of AChE and BACE-1 with IC50 values of 1.43 and 10.9 M, respectively. The derivative 6d inhibits AChE via a mixed-type mode with an inhibition rate constant Ki value of 2.35 M, which was corroborated by docking studies. The triazole 6d has an acceptable stability profile in human liver microsomes t1/2 = 54 min and was found to possess CNS permeability when evaluated using the parallel artificial membrane permeability blood-brain barrier assay. The results presented herein warrant investigating caffeine-based triazoles in preclinical models of Alzheimers disease."
Caffeine,caspase-3 activation,"Adenosine receptor activation is involved in myelination and in apoptotic pathways linked to neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we investigated the effects of adenosine receptor activation in the viability of oligodendrocytes of the rat optic nerve. Selective activation of A3 receptors in pure cultures of oligodendrocytes caused concentration-dependent apoptotic and necrotic death which was preceded by oxidative stress and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Oligodendrocyte apoptosis induced by A3 receptor activation was caspase-dependent and caspase-independent. In addition to dissociated cultures, incubation of optic nerves ex vivo with adenosine and the A3 receptor agonist 2-CI-IB-MECA1-2-Chloro-6-3-iodophenylmethylamino-9H-purin-9-yl-1-deoxy-N-methyl-b-D-ribofuranuronamide-induced caspase-3 activation, oligodendrocyte damage, and myelin loss, effects which were prevented by the presence of caffeine and the A3 receptor antagonist MRS 1220 N-9-Chloro-2-2-furanyl1,2,4-triazolo 1,5-cquinazolin-5-ylbenzene acetamide. Finally, ischemia-induced injury and functional loss to the optic nerve was attenuated by blocking A3 receptors. Together, these results indicate that adenosine may trigger oligodendrocyte death via activation of A3 receptors and suggest that this mechanism contributes to optic nerve and white matter ischemic damage."
Caffeine,caspase-3 activation,"Caffeine is the most commonly ingested methylxanthine and has anti-cancer effects in several types of cancer. In this study, we examined the anti-cancer effects of caffeine on gliomas, both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, caffeine treatment reduced glioma cell proliferation through G0/G1-phase cell cycle arrest by suppressing Rb phosphorylation. In addition, caffeine induced apoptosis through caspase-3 activation and polyADP-ribose polymerase PARP cleavage. Caffeine also phosphorylated serine 9 of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta GSK3. Pretreatment with H89, a pharmacological inhibitor of protein kinase A PKA, was able to antagonize caffeine-induced GSK3ser9 phosphorylation, suggesting that the mechanism might involve a cAMP-dependent PKA-dependent pathway. In vivo, caffeine-treated tumors exhibited reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis compared with vehicle-treated tumors. These results suggest that caffeine induces cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent cell death in glioma cells, supporting its potential use in chemotherapeutic options for malignant gliomas."
Caffeine,caspase-3 activation,"Febrile seizures FS is one of the most common convulsive disorders in infants and young children that only occurs during the first years of life in humans, when the cerebellum is still developing. Several works have shown that maternal caffeine consumption during gestation and lactation can exert protective effects on developing brain under pathological conditions. Here, we have used an animal model of FS to know whether maternal caffeine consumption during gestation and lactation exhibited protective effects on rat cerebellum. Pregnant rats were allowed to freely drink water or caffeine 1 g/l during gestation and lactation. At PD13, neonates were submitted to hyperthermia-induced seizures HIS whereas pups not subject to hyperthermic stimulus were used as controls. 48 h, 5 and 20 days after HIS, rats were killed and plasma membranes and cytosolic fractions were isolated from cerebella. The enzymatic activities of glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, caspase-3, 5-nucleotidase and the levels of thiobarbituric acid reacting substances, adenosine A1 and A2A receptors were studied in these preparations. Furthermore, rats were tested in balance beam test and footprint test 20 days after HIS PD33 in order to investigate the effect on fine motor coordination and gait patterns. Results obtained suggest that maternal caffeine consumption during gestation and lactation exerts two kinds of beneficial effects on cerebellum from rats submitted to HIS a at short term, maternal caffeine abolishes hyperthermic seizures induced-oxidative stress and caspase-3 activation and b in adolescent rats PD33, maternal caffeine prevents fine motor coordination impairment and gait disturbances."
Caffeine,PPARgamma activation,"Current pharmacological regimens for hypertriglyceridemia and low high-density lipoprotein HDL are limited to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPAR alpha activating fibrates, niacin, and statins. This pilot study examined the impact of simultaneous stimulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate with a beta-adrenergic agonist and PPARgamma with pioglitazone PIO on lipoprotein composition in moderately obese, healthy subjects. Subjects were treated with PIO 45 mg to stimulate PPARgamma or a combination of ephedrine 25 mg TID, a beta-agonist, with caffeine 200 mg TID, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor ephedrine plus caffeine, or both for 16 weeks. Lipoproteins were separated by gradient ultracentrifugation into very low-density lipoprotein VLDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein LDL, and 3 HDL L, M, and D subfractions. Apolipoproteins were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. PIO alone reduced the core triglyceride TG content relative to cholesterol ester CE in VLDL -40, IDL -25, and HDL-M -38. Ephedrine plus caffeine alone reduced LDL CE -13, phospholipids -9, and apolipoprotein apo B -13 increased HDL-M LpA-I HDL containing apoA-I without apoA-II, 28, CE/TG 23, and CE/apoA-I 8 while reducing apoA-II -10 and increased HDL-L LpA-I 29. Combination therapy reduced total plasma TG -28, LDL cholesterol LDL-C, -10, apoB -16, apoB/apoA-I ratio -21 while increasing HDL cholesterol HDL-C, 21, total plasma apoA-I 12, LpA-I 43, and apoC-I 26. It also reduced VLDL total mass -34 and apoC-III -39, LDL CE -13, apoB -13, and total mass -11. Combination therapy increased HDL-L CE/TG 32, apoC-I 30, apoA-I 56, and LpA-I 70, as well as HDL-M CE 35, phospholipids 24, total mass 19, apoC-I 25, apoA-I 18, and LpA-I 56. In conclusion, simultaneous beta-adrenergic and PPARgamma activation produced beneficial effects on VLDL, LDL, HDL-L, and HDL-M. Perhaps the most important impact of combination therapy was dramatic increases in LpA-I and apoC-I in HDL-L and HDL-M, which were much greater than the sum of the monotherapies. Because LpA-I appears to be the most efficient mediator of reverse-cholesterol transport and a major negative risk factor for cardiovascular disease, this combination therapy may provide very effective treatment of atherosclerosis."
Caffeine,caspase-3 activation,"Intracellular calcium Ca2i overload induced by chronic hypoxia alters Ca2i homeostasis, which plays an important role on mediating myocardial injury. We tested the hypothesis that treatment with trimetazidine TMZ would improve Ca2i handling in hypoxic myocardial injury. Cardiomyocytes isolated from neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to chronic hypoxia 1 O2, 5 CO2, 37 C. Intracellular calcium concentration Ca2i was measured with Fura-2/AM. Perfusion of cardiomyocytes with a high concentration of caffeine 10 mM was carried out to verify the function of the cardiac Na/Ca2 exchanger NCX and the activity of sarcoendo-plasmic reticulum Ca2-ATPase SERCA2a. For TMZ-treated cardiomyocytes exposured in hypoxia, we observed a decrease in mRNA expression of proapoptotic Bax, caspase-3 activation and enhanced expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. The cardiomyocyte hypertrophy were also alleviated in hypoxic cardiomyocyte treated with TMZ. Moreover, we found that TMZ treatment cardiomyocytes enhanced ""metabolic shift"" from lipid oxidation to glucose oxidation. Compared with hypoxic cardiomyocyte, the diastolic Ca2i was decreased, the amplitude of Ca2i oscillations and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2 load were recovered, the activities of ryanodine receptor 2 RyR2, NCX and SERCA2a were increased in cardiomyocytes treated with TMZ. TMZ attenuated abnormal changes of RyR2 and SERCA2a genes in hypoxic cardiomyocytes. In addition, cholinergic signaling are involved in hypoxic stress and the cardioprotective effects of TMZ. These results suggest that TMZ ameliorates Ca2i homeostasis through switch of lipid to glucose metabolism, thereby producing the cardioprotective effect and reduction in hypoxic cardiomyocytes damage."
Caffeine,caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Cisplatin is an important DNA-damaging anticancer drug that has been used to treat many cancer types. However, the effectiveness of cisplatin treatment diminishes quickly as cancer cells develop resistance to the drug, which eventually results in treatment failure. Caffeine is an ingredient contained in many food sources. Caffeine can inhibit activities of both ATM and ATR, two important protein kinases involved in DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The effect of caffeine on cisplatin-based cancer treatment is not well known.   METHODS Caspase-3 activation and cell growth inhibition assays were used to determine the effect of caffeine on cisplatin-induced apoptosis and cell growth in lung cancer cells. Real time PCR, immunoblotting, and flow cytometry assays were used determine a mechanism through which the presence of caffeine increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis of the lung cancer cells.   RESULTS Our caspase-3 activation studies demonstrated that the presence of caffeine increased the cisplatin-induced apoptosis in both HTB182 and CRL5985 lung cancer cells. Our cell growth inhibition studies indicated that the presence of caffeine caused a more increase for cisplatin-induced cell growth inhibition. The results obtained from our real time PCR and western blot studies revealed that the presence of caffeine increased cisplatin-induced expression of the PUMA pro-apoptotic protein in these lung cancer cells. The results of our protein phosphorylation studies indicated that the presence of caffeine caused a decrease in CHK1 phosphorylation at Ser317/Ser345 but an increase in ATM phosphorylation at Ser1981 in the lung cancer cells treated with cisplatin. In addition, our flow cytometry studies also revealed that the presence of caffeine caused an increase in G1 cell population but a decrease for cisplatin-induced cell cycle arrests at the S and the G2 checkpoints in HTB182 and CRL5985 cells respectively.   CONCLUSION Our results suggest that the presence of caffeine increases the cisplatin-induced lung cancer cell killings by inhibiting ATR but inducing ATM activation, resulting in an increase in expression of PUMA protein and an increase in apoptosis."

Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"In chemical risk assessment, default uncertainty factors are used to account for interspecies and interindividual differences, and differences in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics herein. However, these default factors come with little scientific support. Therefore, our aim was to develop an in vitro method, using acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition as a proof of principle, to assess both interspecies and interindividual differences in toxicodynamics. Electric eel enzyme and human blood of 20 different donors 12 men/8 women were exposed to eight different compounds chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-oxon, phosmet, phosmet-oxon, diazinon, diazinon-oxon, pirimicarb, rivastigmine and inhibition of AChE was measured using the Ellman method. The organophosphate parent compounds, chlorpyrifos, phosmet and diazinon, did not show inhibition of AChE. All other compounds showed concentration-dependent inhibition of AChE, with IC50s in human blood ranging from 0.2-29 M and IC20s ranging from 0.1-18 M, indicating that AChE is inhibited at concentrations relevant to the in vivo human situation. The oxon analogues were more potent inhibitors of electric eel AChE compared to human AChE. The opposite was true for carbamates, pointing towards interspecies differences for AChE inhibition. Human interindividual variability was low and ranged from 5-25, depending on the concentration. This study provides a reliable in vitro method for assessing human variability in AChE toxicodynamics. The data suggest that the default uncertainty factor of  3.16 may overestimate human variability for this toxicity endpoint, implying that specific toxicodynamic-related adjustment factors can support quantitative in vitro to in vivo extrapolations that link kinetic and dynamic data to improve chemical risk assessment."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Nutritional status plays a major role in determining the possible adverse health outcomes due to pesticide toxicity. The objective of the present study was to assess the organophosphorus pesticide residue levels among farm women FW 24-45years and farm children FC 9-12 and 13-15years belonging to the Rangareddy district Telangana, India along with their micronutrient status, inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity, and oxidative stress levels. Residues of Chlorpyrifos, Diazinon, Malathion, Monocrotophos and Phosalone were found in the serum samples of FW and FC along with significantly low levels of vitamins and minerals. Inhibition of AChE activity was observed in FW and FC and altered oxidative stress parameters among FW. Correlation studies have found significant associations between the pesticide residues, micronutrients and antioxidant enzymes. The study suggests an association between pesticide exposure coupled with micronutrient deficiency, induced AChE inhibition, and oxidative stress."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos CPF is a widely used broad-spectrum organophosphate insecticide. CPF elicits neurotoxic effects in exposed organisms by inhibiting the activity of acetylcholinesterase enzymes AChE, which prolongs nerve transmission and results in neurotoxic symptoms and death at high doses. While CPF is capable of eliciting neurotoxic effects, chlorpyrifos-oxon CPFO is the primary neurotoxicant agent. Aquatic organisms bioactivate CPF to CPFO through the Cytochrome P450 phase I metabolic pathway following exposure to CPF. Additionally, in the environment, CPF transforms to CPFO, primarily through photo-oxidation. As both compounds can be transported in air and water to aquatic ecosystems, there is the potential for exposure to non-target organisms. The potential for adverse impacts on aquatic receptors depends on patterns of exposure and toxicity of individual compounds and the mixture. To study the neurotoxicity of these compounds, a 48 h acute and 21 d chronic Daphnia magna bioassay was conducted independently with CPF and CPFO. Acute bioassay results show a median lethal concentration LC50 of 0.76 g L-1 for CPF and 0.32 g L-1 for CPFO, suggesting that CPFO is 2.4 times more acutely toxic to D. magna. Acute assay results were also used to derive Benchmark Dose Levels of 0.58 g L-1 for CPF and 0.25 g L-1 for CPFO. However, neither compound elicited an effect on reproduction or growth at relevant chronic exposures. As D. magna are a small and relatively sensitive species, and the AChE inhibition adverse outcome pathway is highly conserved, these results may be cautiously extrapolated in assessing adverse impacts on aquatic receptors.1."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos CPF biocide, is associated with breast cancer. The processes underlying this association have not been elucidated to date. CPF increases MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation after acute and long-term treatment, partially through KIAA1363 overexpression and aryl-hydrocarbon receptor activation but also through estrogen receptor-alpha activation after 24 h exposure in MCF-7 cells, suggesting other mechanisms may be involved. CPF induces reactive oxygen species ROS generation, acetylcholine accumulation, and overexpression of acetylcholinesterase-R/S AChE-R/S variants, while it also alters the Wnt/-catenin pathway, both in vitro and in vivo, in processes different from cancer. These latter mechanisms are also linked to cell proliferation and could mediate this effect induced by CPF. Our results show that CPF 0.01-100 M, following one-day and fourteen-days treatment, respectively, induced ROS generation and lipid peroxidation, and acetylcholine accumulation due to AChE inhibition, Wnt/-catenin up- or downregulation depending on the CPF treatment concentration, and AChE-R and AChE-S overexpression, with the latter being mediated through GSK-3 activity alteration. Finally, CPF promoted cell division through ACh and ROS accumulation, AChE-R overexpression, and Wnt/-catenin signaling disruption. Our results provide novel information on the effect of CPF on human breast cancer cell lines that may help to explain its involvement in breast cancer."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"The organophosphorus OP and carbamate CB insecticides are responsible for inhibition of the Acetylcholinesterase AChE enzyme. The AChE activity, therefore, has been demonstrated to be a potent biomarker for these insecticides in terrestrial and aquatic environments. The objective of this study was to investigate the response of AChE in the brain of four-week old fingerlings of silver perch, Bidyanus bidyanus exposed to OP and CB insecticides. The fish fingeling were exposed to three OPs and one CB insecticide as individual and their binary mixtures for 48 h. The OP insecticides with oxon PO as well as thion PS group gets oxidized to oxon analogs in biological systems. The 50 AChE inhibition 48 h EC50 in fingerling exposed to chlorpyrifos CPF and triazophos TRZ was evident at 2.3 and 6.7 g/L, respectively. The toxicological interaction of three OPs and one CB insecticide was evaluated using the toxic unit method. A strong synergism was observed for binary combination of CPF with profenofos PRF, and CPF with TAZ. In contrast, the mixture of TAZ with PRF and carbofuran CBF with CPF and PRF showed antagonistic behavior. Although OP and CB insecticides can break down rapidly in the environment, this study suggests that non-target aquatic biota may be exposed to mixtures of ChE-inhibiting insecticides for a period of several months, in agricultural regions where insecticides are applied for extended periods of the year. And at environmentally relevant concentrations such mixtures may lead to deleterious effects in non-target organisms."
Chlorpyrifos,caspase-3 activation,"This study probed the neuroprotective influence of indole-3-propionic acid IPA in rats exposed to chlorpyrifos CPF alone at 5 mg/kg body weight or co-administered with IPA at 12.5 and 25 mg/kg for 14 days. Behavioral data indicated that IPA significantly p lt 0.05 abated CPF-mediated anxiogenic-like behaviors with concomitant improvement in the locomotor and exploratory behaviors as substantiated by track plots and heat maps data. Also, IPA mitigated CPF-mediated diminution in cholinergic and antioxidant defense systems whereas it markedly improved thioredoxin level and thioredoxin reductase activity in cerebral and cerebellar tissues of the animals. Co-administration of IPA significantly enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10 but suppressed oxidative and inflammatory stress, caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation with concomitant reduction in 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine 8-OHdG level and histological damage. Collectively, IPA-mediated neuroprotection involves modulation of cholinergic and redox-regulatory systems, inflammatory stress, apoptotic responses and DNA damage in cerebrum and cerebellum of rats."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"A sensitive assay was developed to evaluate inhibitory effects of aqueous solution on acetylcholinesterase AChE activity via measuring hydrolysis rates of acetylcholine ACh based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry UPLC-MS/MS. Upon having identified precursor ions and product ions of the ACh and its hydrolysis products choline Ch, the separation chromatogram for these two analytes has been established using a 50 mm reverse-phase BEH Shield RP18 column. The total chromatographic separation time is 7 min limits of detection LODs for ACh and Ch are 0.14 g L-1 and 0.12 g L-1, respectively. A simple method for inactivation of AChE and optimization of operational parameters were then sequentially performed. It was found that adjusting solution pH to 2.5 not only can terminate the enzymatic reaction but also solve band shifting and broadening caused by aqueous matrices in chromatographic separation during UPLC-MS/MS detection. Under conditions of 0.00075 U mL-1 AChE, initial concentration of ACh at 100 g L-1 and 20 min observation time, IC50 values of the proposed assay for chlorpyrifos-oxon, diazoxon, malaoxon, methidathion oxon, omethoate and paraoxon were 3.5 nM, 16.8 nM, 2.4 nM, 6.8 nM, 270 nM and 36.9 nM, respectively. They are 4.5-51.9 times smaller than those reported in a LC-MS based method, and gt120 times lower than those obtained by the traditional Ellman method. The results suggested that, the proposed assay significantly increases the sensitivity of commercial AChE. In addition, inhibition efficiencies of three surface waters, a groundwater and four commercial brands of bottled drinking water samples on AChE activity were firstly measured using this UPLC-MS/MS based method. These water samples were proved to have different inhibitory effects on AChE activity, and the inhibition efficiencies dependent on concentrations of dissolved organic carbon DOC but are independent of UV absorbance at 254 nm UV254 values. These results indicate that the proposed method has advantages of high sensitivity over all other conventional methods. It may become a promising AChE inhibition assay for assessing toxicity of aqueous solution containing neurotoxicity contaminants such as organophosphorus pesticides OPPs at low levels, or used to evaluate potential inhibition effects of natural waters on AChE activity."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Currently, there is a lack of knowledge about the effects of co-exposures of cannabis, contaminated with pesticides like chlorpyrifos CPF and the toxic metabolite CPF-oxon CPFO. CPF/CPFO residues, and 9Tetrahydrocannabinol 9THC, the main component in cannabis, are known to disrupt the endocannabinoid system eCBS resulting in neurodevelopmental defects. Although there are in vivo data characterizing CPF/CPFO and 9THC, there are mechanistic data gaps and deficiencies. In this study, an investigation of open access CompTox tools and ToxCast/Tox21 data was performed to determine targets relating to the modes of action MOA for these compounds and, given the available biological targets, predict points of departure POD. The main findings were as follows 1 In vivo PODs for each chemical were from open literature, 2 Concordance between ToxCast/Tox21 assay targets and known targets in the metabolic and eCBS pathways was evaluated, 3 Human Equivalent Administered Dose EADHuman PODs showed the High throughput toxicokinetic HTTK 3 compartment model 3COMP was more predictive of in vivo PODs than the PBTK model for CPF, CPFO and 9THC, 4 Age-adjusted 3COMP HTTK-Pop EADHuman, with CPF and CPFO ToxCast/Tox21 AC50 values as inputs were predictive for ages 0-4 when but not 9THC compared to in vivo PODs. 5 Age-related refinements for CPF/CPFO were primarily from ToxCast/Tox21 active hit-calls for nuclear receptors, CYP2B6 and AChE inhibition CPFO only associated with the metabolic pathway. Only one assay target arylhydrocarbon hydroxylase receptor was common between CPF/CPFO and 9THC. While computational refinements may select some sensitive events involved in the metabolic pathways this is highly dependent on the cytotoxicity limits, availability of metabolic activity in the ToxCast/Tox21 assays and reliability of assay performance. Some uncertainties and data gaps for 9THC might be addressed with assays specific to the eCBS. For CPF, assays with appropriate metabolic activation could better represent the toxic pathway."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"The present study compares two approaches to evaluate the effects of inter-individual differences in the biotransformation of chlorpyrifos CPF on the sensitivity towards in vivo red blood cell RBC acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition and to calculate a chemical-specific adjustment factor CSAF to account for inter-individual differences in kinetics HKAF. These approaches included use of a Supersome cytochromes P450 CYP-based and a human liver microsome HLM-based physiologically based kinetic PBK model, both combined with Monte Carlo simulations. The results revealed that bioactivation of CPF exhibits biphasic kinetics caused by distinct differences in the Km of CYPs involved, which was elucidated by Supersome CYP rather than by HLM. Use of Supersome CYP-derived kinetic data was influenced by the accuracy of the intersystem extrapolation factors ISEFs required to scale CYP isoform activity of Supersome to HLMs. The predicted dose-response curves for average, 99th percentile and 1st percentile sensitive individuals were found to be similar in the two approaches when biphasic kinetics was included in the HLM-based approach, resulting in similar benchmark dose lower confidence limits for 10 inhibition BMDL10 and HKAF values. The variation in metabolism-related kinetic parameters resulted in HKAF values at the 99th percentile that were slightly higher than the default uncertainty factor of 3.16. While HKAF values up to 6.9 were obtained when including also the variability in other influential PBK model parameters. It is concluded that the Supersome CYP-based approach appeared most adequate for identifying inter-individual variation in biotransformation of CPF and its resulting RBC AChE inhibition."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos CP and its highly electrophilic intermediates are principal toxic metabolites. The active form of CP i.e. chlorpyrifos oxon CP-oxon is responsible for both the insecticidal activity and is also of greater risk when present in the atmosphere. Thus, the combined effects of both CP, CP-oxan, and other metabolites enhance our understanding of the safety and risk of the insecticide CP. They cause major toxicities such as AChE inhibition, oxidative stress, and endocrine disruption. Further, it can have adverse hematological, musculoskeletal, renal, ocular, and dermal effects. Excessive use of this compound results in poisoning and potentially kills a non-target species upon exposure including humans. Several examples of reactive metabolites toxicities on plants, aquatic life, and soil are presented herein. The review covers the general overview on reactive metabolites of CP, chemistry and their mechanism through toxic effects on humans as well as on the environment. Considerable progress has been made in the replacement or alternative to CP. The different strategies including antidote mechanisms for the prevention and treatment of CP poisoning are discussed in this review. The approach analyses also the active metabolites for the pesticide activity and thus it becomes more important to know the pesticide and toxicity dose of CP as much as possible."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos CPF is a common organophosphate OP insecticide that has been widely used in agriculture as a pesticide. The primary mechanism of acute toxic action of OPs is initiated by acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition. However, non-AChE targets have also been proposed as alternative that contributes to the acute lethal action and side effects of short or long-term exposure. Recently, we have found that a single dose of 250 mg/kg CPF produces acceleration in acquisition on schedule-induced polydipsia SIP procedure 6 months after its administration. Moreover, CPF animals show a higher level of impulsivity in a delay-discounting task 1 year after acute administration, and these effects are potentiated when animals are divided into high HD and low LD drinkers in SIP. In the present study, rats were injected with a subcutaneous sc dose of 250 mg/kg of CPF, and 10 weeks later its effect on delay-discounting task was evaluated. Consequently, these animals were evaluated based on SIP, and divided into two populations HD and LD according to their rates of drinking in this task. One year after OP administration, these animals were re-evaluated in a delay-discounting task. Results revealed that the CPF-administered rats prefer immediate reward and show a more impulsive choice, 10 weeks after CPF administration. Furthermore, 1 year after it administration, only animals treated with CPF that are high drinkers on SIP are more impulsive than the rest of the groups Therefore, these data suggest that some individuals are more sensitive to OP intoxication than the others, at least in terms of durability of sequelae."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Routine use of tobacco products may modify physiological and metabolic functions, including drug metabolizing enzymes, which may impact the pharmacokinetics of environmental contaminants. Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphorus OP insecticide that is bioactivated to chlorpyrifos-oxon, and manifests its neurotoxicity by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase AChE. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of repeated nicotine exposure on the pharmacokinetics of chlorpyrifos CPF and its major metabolite, 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol TCPy in blood and urine and also to determine the impact on cholinesterase ChE activity in plasma and brain. Animals were exposed to 7-daily doses of either 1mg nicotine/kg or saline, and to either a single oral dose of 35mg CPF/kg or a repeated dose of 5mg CPF/kg/day for 7 days. Groups of rats were then sacrificed at multiple time-points after receiving the last dose of CPF. Repeated nicotine and CPF exposures resulted in enhanced metabolism of CPF to TCPy, as evidenced by increases in the measured TCPy peak concentration and AUC in blood. However, there was no significant difference in the amount of TCPy free or total excreted in the urine within the first 24-h post last dose. The extent of brain acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition was reduced due to nicotine co-exposure consistent with an increase in CYP450-mediated dearylation detoxification versus desulfuration. It was of interest to note that the impact of nicotine co-exposure was experimentally observed only after repeated CPF doses. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for CPF was used to simulate the effect of increasing the dearylation Vmax based upon previously conducted in vitro metabolism studies. Predicted CPF-oxon concentrations in blood and brain were lower following the expected Vmax increase in nicotine treated groups. These model results were consistent with the experimental data. The current study demonstrated that repeated nicotine exposure could alter CPF metabolism in vivo, resulting in altered brain AChE inhibition."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Considering the wide variety of effects that have been reported to occur in the developmental neurotoxicity of chlorpyrifos CP and the lack of consensus on their dependence of brain acetylcholinesterase AChE activity inhibition, we applied microarray technology to explore dose-dependent alterations in transcriptional response in the fetal and maternal C57BL/6 mouse brain after daily gestational exposure days 6 to 17 to CP 2, 4, 10, 12 or 15 mg/kg, sc. We identified significantly altered genes across doses and assessed for overrepresentation of Gene Ontology GO biological processes and KEGG pathways. We further clustered genes based on their expression profiles across doses and repeated the GO/pathways analysis for each cluster. The dose-effect relationship of CP on gene expression, both at the gene and pathway levels was non-monotonic and not necessarily related to brain AChE inhibition. The largest impact was observed in the 10mg/kg dose group which was also the LOAEL for brain AChE inhibition. In the maternal brain, lower doses 4 mg/kg influenced GO categories and pathways such as cell adhesion, behavior, lipid metabolism, long-term potentiation, nervous system development, neurogenesis, synaptic transmission. In the fetal brain, lower doses 2 and/or 4 mg/kg significantly altered cell division, translation, transmission of nerve impulse, chromatin modification, long-term potentiation. In addition, some genes involved in nervous system development and signaling were shown to be specifically influenced by these lower CP doses. Our approach was sensitive and reflected the diversity of responses known to be disrupted by CP and highlighted possible additional consequences of CP neurotoxicity, such as disturbance of the ubiquitin proteasome system."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Human and experimental animal studies have shown long- and short-term neurological sequelae following acute organophosphate OP exposure. Although the main molecular mechanism of OP neurotoxiicty involves acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition, studies have also implicated the induction of oxidative stress. The present study was therefore aimed at evaluating the effect of acute chlorpyrifos CPF exposure on short-term sensorimotor and cognitive changes in Wistar rats, the role of brain lipoperoxidative changes and the effect of pretreatment with vitamin C. Twenty-eight rats divided into four groups of seven rats in each group served as subjects for this study. Rats in group I were given soya oil 2 ml/kg while those in group II were dosed vitamin C 100 mg/kg. Group III were administered CPF only 42.5 mg/kg 50 of LD50, while group IV were pretreated with vitamin C 100 mg/kg and then exposed to CPF 42.5 mg/kg, 30 min later. The regimens were administered once orally and the animals were examined for clinical signs, death and subjected to periodic neurobehavioral evaluation for motor strength, coordinated gait, neuromuscular coordination, learning and memory. At the end of 8 weeks of evaluation, the rats were sacrificed and the brain tissue evaluated for AChE activity and malonaldehyde MDA concentration, as an index of lipoperoxidative changes. The rats administered with CPF showed deficits in motor strength, coordinated gaits, neuromuscular coordination, learning and memory, slight decrease in AChE activity and an increase in brain MDA concentration. Pretreatment with vitamin C improved the neurobehavioral deficits and AChE activity, and caused a significant reduction in MDA concentration. In conclusion, the study has demonstrated that acute CPF exposure in Wistar rats caused short-term impairment in sensorimotor and cognitive functions partly due to brain lipoperoxidative changes, which were ameliorated by pretreatment with vitamin C."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos CPF is a widely used organophosphorus insecticide OP and putative developmental neurotoxicant in humans. The acute toxicity of CPF is elicited by acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition. We characterized dose-related 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2mg/kg gene expression profiles and changes in cell signaling pathways 24h following acute CPF exposure in 7-day-old rats. Microarray experiments indicated that approximately 9 of the 44,000 genes were differentially expressed following either one of the four CPF dosages studied 546, 505, 522, and 3,066 genes with 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0mg/kg CPF. Genes were grouped according to dose-related expression patterns using K-means clustering while gene networks and canonical pathways were evaluated using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Twenty clusters were identified and differential expression of selected genes was verified by RT-PCR. The four largest clusters each containing from 276 to 905 genes constituted over 50 of all differentially expressed genes and exhibited up-regulation following exposure to the highest dosage 2mg/kg CPF. The total number of gene networks affected by CPF also rose sharply with the highest dosage of CPF 18, 16, 18 and 50 with 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2mg/kg CPF. Forebrain cholinesterase ChE activity was significantly reduced 26 only in the highest dosage group. Based on magnitude of dose-related changes in differentially expressed genes, relative numbers of gene clusters and signaling networks affected, and forebrain ChE inhibition only at 2mg/kg CPF, we focused subsequent analyses on this treatment group. Six canonical pathways were identified that were significantly affected by 2mg/kg CPF MAPK, oxidative stress, NFB, mitochondrial dysfunction, arylhydrocarbon receptor and adrenergic receptor signaling. Evaluation of different cellular functions of the differentially expressed genes suggested changes related to olfactory receptors, cell adhesion/migration, synapse/synaptic transmission and transcription/translation. Nine genes were differentially affected in all four CPF dosing groups. We conclude that the most robust, consistent changes in differential gene expression in neonatal forebrain across a range of acute CPF dosages occurred at an exposure level associated with the classical marker of OP toxicity, AChE inhibition. Disruption of multiple cellular pathways, in particular cell adhesion, may contribute to the developmental neurotoxicity potential of this pesticide."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"The toxicity of carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, dimethoate and profenofos to the freshwater shrimp, Paratya australiensis was assessed by measuring acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition after 96h exposures. Shrimp exposed to these pesticides exhibited significant AChE inhibition, with mortality in shrimp corresponding to 70-90 AChE inhibition. The sensitivity of P. australiensis to the four pesticides based on AChE inhibition can be given as chlorpyrifos gt profenofos gt carbaryl gt dimethoate. Recovery of AChE activity was followed in shrimp after 96 h exposures to carbaryl, chlorpyrifos and dimethoate. Recovery after exposure to the carbamate pesticide carbaryl was more rapid than for the two organophosphorus pesticides, chlorpyrifos and dimethoate. The slow recovery of depressed AChE activity may mean that affected organisms in the natural system are unable to sustain physical activities such as searching for food or eluding predators. To investigate the ecological significance of AChE inhibition, chemotaxis behaviour was assessed in shrimp exposed to profenofos for 24h. Abnormal chemotaxis behaviour in the exposed shrimp was observed at concentrations representing 30-50 AChE inhibition. A clear relationship existed between the depression of AChE activity and observed chemotaxis responses, such as approaching and grasping the chemoattractant source. These results suggest that in vivo toxicity tests based on this specific biomarker are sensitive and present advantages over conventional acute tests based on mortality. Behavioural studies of test organisms conducted in conjunction with measurement of AChE inhibition will provide data to clarify the toxic effects caused by sublethal chemical concentrations of anti-cholinesterase compounds."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Pesticides are used extensively throughout the world in agriculture and in pest control as well as for community health purposes. Organophosphate OP pesticide self-poisoning is an important clinical problem in rural regions of the developing world that kills an estimated 200,000 people every year. Unintentional poisoning kills far fewer people but is an apparent problem in places where highly toxic OP pesticides are available. Neurologic dysfunction is the best documented health effect of pesticide exposure. High-level exposure has both acute and long-term neurologic signs and symptoms, and adverse effects have been reported in most type of pesticides, including organophosphate OP, carbamate, organochlorine, and pyrethroid insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and fumigants. Acute OP pesticide exposure can involve in wide range of both central and peripheral neurologic symptoms. Increased neurologic symptom prevalence may provide early evidence of neurologic dysfunctions, before clinically measurable signs are evident.In this study, we analyzed the cross-sectional data on neurologic signs and symptoms from 225 rural children, both males n = 132 and females n = 93 who were occupationally and paraoccupationally exposed to methyl OPs dichlorvos, fenthion, malathion, methyl parathion and ethyl OPs chlorpyrifos, diazinon, ethyl parathion as they belonged to agricultural families handling, mixing, and spraying the OP pesticides. The children completed a specially designed questionnaire Q16 on neurologic symptoms associated with pesticide exposure with their parental help. A suitable reference group consisting of rural children n = 50 never involved in pesticide handling neither outdoor nor indoor belonging to similar socioeconomic strata included in the study to compare the prevalence of various neurologic symptoms between the two groups.Among all the neurologic self-reported symptoms, headache, watering in eyes, and burning sensation in eye/face were the most important clinical manifestations attributed to OP pesticide exposure. These symptoms could probably be the consequence of chronic effects of most pesticides on the central nervous system. The muscarinic symptoms reported the maximum prevalence of salivation 18.22, whereas lacrimation was observed in 17.33 cases, followed by diarrhea in 9.33 cases. The nicotinic clinical manifestations of acute OP poisoning revealed excessive sweating in 13.78 cases and tremors in 9.3 cases followed by mydriasis in 8.4 exposed children. The characteristic cholinergic symptoms, such as insomnia, headache, muscle cramps, weakness, and anorexia were also reported by both male and female exposed children. The high frequency of neurologic symptoms observed in the study may be due to parasympathetic hyperactivity due to the accumulated ACh resulting from AChE inhibition."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"The paper presents a case study of the application of a ""source-to-outcome"" model for the evaluation of the health outcomes from dietary exposures to an insecticide, chlorpyrifos, in populations of adults age 30 and children age 3. The model is based on publically-available software programs that characterize the longitudinal dietary exposure and anthropometry of exposed individuals. These predictions are applied to a validated PBPK/PD model to estimate interindividual and longitudinal variation in brain and RBC AChE inhibition key events and chlorpyrifos concentrations in blood and TCPy in urine biomarkers of exposure. The predicted levels of chlorpyrifos and TCPy are compared to published measurements of the biomarkers. Predictions of RBC AChE are compared to levels of inhibition associated with reported exposure-related effects in humans to determine the potential for the occurrence of adverse cholinergic effects. The predicted distributions of chlorpyrifos in blood and TCPy in urine were found to be reasonably consistent with published values, supporting the predictive value of the exposure and PBPK portions of the source-to-outcome model. Key sources of uncertainty in predictions of dietary exposures were investigated and found to have a modest impact on the model predictions. Future versions of this source-to-outcome model can be developed that consider advances in our understanding of metabolism, to extend the approach to other age groups infants, and address intakes from other routes of exposure."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Previous work in our laboratory has shown that sub-lethal concentrations 1-10 M of chlorpyrifos CPF, diazinon DZ and diazinon oxon DZO inhibit the outgrowth of axon-like neurites in differentiating mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells concomitant with altered levels and/or phosphorylation state of axonal cytoskeleton and growth-associated proteins. The aim of the present work was to determine whether chlorpyrifos oxon CPO was capable of inhibiting N2a cell differentiation in a similar manner. Using experimental conditions similar to our previous work, sub-lethal concentrations 1-10 M of CPO were found to inhibit N2a cell differentiation. However, unlike previous studies with DZ and DZO, there was a high level of sustained inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE in CPO treated cells. Impairment of neurite outgrowth was also associated with reduced levels of growth associated protein-43 and neurofilament heavy chain NFH, and the distribution of NFH in cells stained by indirect immunofluorescence was disrupted. However, in contrast to previous findings for DZO, the absolute level of phosphorylated NFH was unaffected by CPO exposure. Taken together, the findings suggest that sub-lethal concentrations of CPO inhibit axon outgrowth in differentiating N2a cells and that this effect involves reduced levels of two proteins that play key roles in axon outgrowth and maintenance. Although the inhibition of neurite outgrowth is unlikely to involve AChE inhibition directly, further work will help to determine whether the persistent inhibition of AChE by CPO can account for the different effects induced by CPO and DZO on the levels of total and phosphorylated NFH."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos CPF is a commonly used organophosphorus pesticide. Several pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted in rats in which CPF was administered as a single bolus dose. However, there is limited data regarding the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics following daily exposure. Since occupational exposures often consist of repeated, daily exposures, there is a need to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CPF under exposure conditions which more accurately reflect real world human exposures. In this study, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CPF were assessed in male Long-Evans rats exposed daily to CPF 0, 3 or 10mg/kg/day, s.c. in peanut oil over a 10 day study period. Throughout the study, multiple pharmacokinetic urinary TCPy levels and tissue CPF and metabolite levels and pharmacodynamic blood and brain AChE activity determinants were measured. Average blood AChE activity on day 10 was 54 and 33 of baseline among animals in the 3 and 10mg/kg/day CPF treatment groups, respectively, while average brain AChE activity was 67 and 28 of baseline. Comparable dose-response relationships between brain AChE inhibition and blood AChE inhibition, suggests that blood AChE activity is a valid biomarker of brain AChE activity. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic measures collected in this study were also used to optimize a rat physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic PBPK/PD model for multiple s.c. exposures to CPF based on a previously published rat PBPK/PD model for CPF following a single bolus injection. This optimized model will be useful for determining pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses over a wide range of doses and durations of exposure, which will improve extrapolation of results between rats and humans."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Organophosphate OP compounds exert inhibition on cholinesterase ChE activity by irreversibly binding to the catalytic site of the enzyme. Oximes are compounds generally used to reverse the ChE inhibition caused by OP agents. In this study, we compared the in vitro reactivation potency of two new oximes oxime 1 butane-2,3-dionethiosemicarbazone oxime 2 3-phenylhydrazono butan-2-one against the inhibition on acetylcholinesterase AChE and butyrylcholinesterase BChE activities induced by chlorpyrifos, diazinon and malathion. Oximes used clinically obidoxime and pralidoxime were used as positive control. For this study, human blood erythrocytes for AChE determination and plasma for BChE determination was used and different concentrations of oximes 1-100 M were tested. The concentrations of OP used were based on the IC50 for AChE and BChE. Results demonstrated that obidoxime was more effective in reactivate the AChE inhibition induced by OP compounds. However, both newly developed oximes achieved similar reactivations rates that pralidoxime for chlorpyrifos and diazinon-inhibited AChE. For BChE reactivation, none of evaluated oximes achieved positives rates of reactivation, been obidoxime able to reactivate malathion-inhibited BChE only in 24 at the highest concentration. We conclude that both newly developed oximes seem to be promising reactivators of OP-inhibited AChE."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Organophosphorus OP compounds are a diverse chemical group that includes nerve agents and pesticides. They share a common chemical signature that facilitates their binding and adduction of acetylcholinesterase AChE within nerve synapses to induce cholinergic toxicity. However, this group diversity results in non-uniform binding and inactivation of other secondary protein targets, some of which may be adducted and protein activity influenced, even when only a relatively minor portion of tissue AChE is inhibited. The determination of individual OP protein binding targets has been hampered by the sensitivity of methods of detection and quantification of protein-pesticide adducts. We have overcome this limitation by the employment of a microchannel plate MCP autoradiographic detector to monitor a radiolabelled OP tracer compound. We preincubated rat thymus tissue in vitro with the OP pesticides, azamethiphos-oxon, chlorfenvinphos-oxon, chlorpyrifos-oxon, diazinon-oxon, and malaoxon, and then subsequently radiolabelled the free OP binding sites remaining with 3H-diisopropylfluorophosphate 3H-DFP. Proteins adducted by OP pesticides were detected as a reduction in 3H-DFP radiolabelling after protein separation by one dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantitative digital autoradiography using the MCP imager. Thymus tissue proteins of molecular weights -28 kDa, 59 kDa, 66 kDa, and 82 kDa displayed responsiveness to adduction by this panel of pesticides. The 59 kDa protein target previously putatively identified as carboxylesterase I was only significantly adducted by chlorfenvinphos-oxon p lt 0.001, chlorpyrifos-oxon p lt 0.0001, and diazinon-oxon p lt 0.01, the 66 kDa protein target previously identified as serum albumin similarly only adducted by the same three pesticides p lt 0.0001, p lt 0.001, and p lt 0.01, and the 82 kDa protein target previously identified as acyl peptide hydrolase only adducted by chlorpyrifos-oxon p lt 0.0001 and diazinon-oxon p lt 0.001, when the average values of tissue AChE inhibition were 30, 35, and 32 respectively. The -28 kDa protein target was shown to be heterogeneous in nature and was resolved to reveal nineteen 3H-DFP radiolabelled protein spots by two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and MCP autoradiography. Some of these 3H-DFP proteins spots were responsive to adduction by preincubation with chlorfenvinphos-oxon. In addition, we exploited the useful spatial resolution of the MCP imager -70 mm to determine pesticide micolocalisation in vivo, after animal dosing and autoradiography of brain tissue sections. Collectively, MCP autoradiographic imaging provided a means to detect targets of OP pesticides, quantify their sensitivity of adduction relative to tissue AChE inhibition, and highlighted that these common pesticides exhibit specific binding character to protein targets, and therefore their toxicity will need to be evaluated on an individual compound basis. In addition, MCP autoradiography afforded a useful method of visualisation of the localisation of a small radiolabelled tracer within brain tissue."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Zebrafish are increasingly used for developmental neurotoxicity testing because early embryonic events are easy to visualize, exposures are done without affecting the mother and the rapid development of zebrafish allows for high throughput testing. We used zebrafish to examine how exposures to three different organophosphorus pesticides chlorpyrifos, diazinon and parathion over the first five days of embryonic and larval development of zebrafish affected their survival, acetylcholinesterase AChE activity and behavior. We show that at non-lethal, equimolar concentrations, chlorpyrifos CPF is more effective at equimolar concentrations than diazinon DZN and parathion PA in producing AChE inhibition. As concentrations of DZN and PA are raised, lethality occurs before they can produce the degree of AChE inhibition observed with CPF at 300 nM. Because of its availability outside the mother at the time of fertilization, zebrafish provides a complementary model for studying the neurotoxicity of very early developmental exposures."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE and butyrylcholinesterase BChE activity is an established biomarker of exposure to organophosphorus poisons OP. Inhibition of activity is due to covalent binding of the OP to the active site serine. Mass spectrometry has made it possible to monitor OP exposure by analyzing OP adducts on tyrosine in proteins that have no active site serine. Our goal was to test the hypothesis that OP-tyrosine may serve as a biomarker of OP exposure in mice. A MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry strategy to analyze diethoxyphosphate-tyrosine of m/z 318 was developed. The adduct was synthesized by incubating l-tyrosine with chlorpyrifos oxon at pH 8.1. The adduct eluted from a reverse phase HPLC column with 22-23 acetonitrile. The fragmentation spectrum of the m/z 318 precursor ion confirmed its identity as diethoxyphosphate-tyrosine. Diethoxyphosphate-tyrosine was isolated from chlorpyrifos oxon treated mouse albumin after digesting the protein with pronase. Mice n=3 per group were treated with a nontoxic dose of chlorpyrifos oxon 3 mg/kg and a toxic dose 10 mg/kg transdermally. The pronase digested plasma yielded diethoxyphosphate-tyrosine up to 120 h after treatment with 3 mg/kg chlorpyrifos oxon and up to 144 h after 10 mg/kg. In contrast plasma AChE activity returned to normal after 24-72 h. In conclusion MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry can be used to diagnose exposure to chlorpyrifos oxon days after AChE inhibition assays are uninformative.
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos CPF, one of the most widely-used organophosphorus OP insecticides in agriculture, is degraded in the field to its oxon form, chlorpyrifos-oxon CPO, which can represent a significant contaminant in exposures to adults and children. CPO is also responsible for the acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition associated with CPF exposures CPF is converted by liver CYP450 enzymes to CPO, which binds to and inhibits AChE and other serine active-site esterases, lipases and proteases. Young children represent a particularly susceptible population for exposure to CPF and CPO, in part because levels of the plasma enzyme, paraoxonase PON1, which hydrolyzes CPO, are very low during early development. While a number of studies have demonstrated developmental neurotoxicity associated with CPF exposure, including effects at or below the threshold levels for AChE inhibition, it is unclear whether these effects were due directly to CPF or to its active metabolite, CPO. PON1 knockout PON1-/- mice, which lack PON1, represent a highly sensitive mouse model for toxicity associated with exposure to CPF or CPO. To examine the neurobehavioral consequences of CPO exposure during postnatal development, PON1-/- mice were exposed daily from PND 4 to PND 21 to CPO at 0.15, 0.18, or 0.25 mg/kg/d. A neurobehavioral test battery did not reveal significant effects of CPO on early reflex development, motor coordination, pre-pulse inhibition of startle, startle amplitude, open field behavior, or learning and memory in the contextual fear conditioning, Morris water maze, or water radial-arm maze tests. However, body weight gain and startle latency were significantly affected by exposure to 0.25 mg/kg/d CPO. Additionally, from PNDs 15-20 the mice exposed repeatedly to CPO at all three doses exhibited a dose-related transient hyperkinesis in the 20-min period following CPO administration, suggesting possible effects on catecholaminergic neurotransmission. Our previous study demonstrated wide-ranging effects of neonatal CPO exposure on gene expression in the brain and on brain AChE inhibition, and modulation of both of these effects by the PON1Q192R polymorphism. The current study indicates that the neurobehavioral consequences of these effects are more elusive, and suggests that alternative neurobehavioral tests might be warranted, such as tests of social interactions, age-dependent effects on learning and memory, or tests designed specifically to assess dopaminergic or noradrenergic function."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos CPF is one of the most widely used organophosphate insecticides in the United States. By December 2000, nearly all residential uses were voluntarily canceled, so that today, CPF is only used to control insect pests on a variety of crops. Periodic review of the potential effects of CPF on all developmental outcomes is necessary in the United States because the Food Quality Protection Act mandates special consideration of risk assessments for infants and children. This article reviews epidemiologic studies examining the association of potential CPF exposure with growth indices, including birth weight, birth length, and head circumference, and animal studies focusing on related somatic developmental endpoints. It differs from earlier reviews by including an additional cohort study and providing in-depth systematic evaluation of the patterns of association across different studies with respect to specificity of biomarkers for CPF, consistency, dose response, strength of association, temporality, and biological plausibility Hill 1965, as well as consideration of the potential role of effect modification and bias. The review did not identify any strong associations exhibiting consistent exposure-response patterns that were observed in more than one of the four cohort studies evaluated. In addition, the animal data indicate that developmental effects occur at doses that produce substantial maternal toxicity and red blood cell RBC acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition. Based on consideration of both the epidemiologic and animal data, maternal RBC AChE inhibition is a more sensitive endpoint for risk assessment than somatic developmental effects reviewed in this article."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Cumulative risk assessment has been proposed as an approach to evaluate the health risks associated with simultaneous exposure to multiple chemical and non-chemical stressors. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic PBPK/PD models can allow for the inclusion and evaluation of multiple stressors, including non-chemical stressors, but studies have not leveraged PBPK/PD models to jointly consider these disparate exposures in a cumulative risk context. In this study, we focused on exposures to organophosphate OP pesticides for children in urban low-income environments, where these children would be simultaneously exposed to other pesticides including pyrethroids and non-chemical stressors that may modify the effects of these exposures including diet. We developed a methodological framework to evaluate chemical and non-chemical stressor impacts on OPs, utilizing an existing PBPK/PD model for chlorpyrifos. We evaluated population-specific stressors that would influence OP doses or acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition, the relevant PD outcome. We incorporated the impact of simultaneous exposure to pyrethroids and dietary factors on OP dose through the compartments of metabolism and PD outcome within the PBPK model, and simulated combinations of stressors across multiple exposure ranges and potential body weights. Our analyses demonstrated that both chemical and non-chemical stressors can influence the health implications of OP exposures, with up to 5-fold variability in AChE inhibition across combinations of stressor values for a given OP dose. We demonstrate an approach for modeling OP risks in the presence of other population-specific environmental stressors, providing insight about co-exposures and variability factors that most impact OP health risks and contribute to childrens cumulative health risk from pesticides. More generally, this framework can be used to inform cumulative risk assessment for any compound impacted by chemical and non-chemical stressors through metabolism or PD outcomes."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Organophosphates OPs are important toxic compounds commonly used for a variety of purposes in agriculture, industry and household settings. It has been well established that the main mechanism of acute toxic action of OP is the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE. However, we observed long term deficit after acute subcutaneous exposure to Chlorpyrifos CPF even when AChE activity is restored. In fact, besides AChE inhibition, non-AChE targets have also been proposed as an alternative mechanism involved in the acute lethal action and side effects of short or long-term exposure. In this context, our main aim in this research was to establish a dose-response curve of Acylpeptide hydrolase APH and AChE regional brain activity after acute CPF administration that could explain these long term effects observed in the literature. Moreover, since available data suggest that long term effects of OPs exposure could involve neuronal cell death, our second aim was to evaluate, assessing by Fluoro-Jade B FJB staining, whether CPF produces induced cell death. Our results show that an acute exposure to 250 mg/kg CPF does not induce neuronal death as measured by FJB but produces highest AChE regional brain inhibition after administration. In addition, APH seems to be more sensitive than AChE to CPF exposure because after 31 days of exposure, complete recovery was seen only for APH activity at Frontal Cortex, Cerebellum and Brain Stem."
Chlorpyrifos,caspase-3 activation,"Recent studies have demonstrated that dynamin-related protein 1 Drp1, a mitochondrial fission protein, mediates mitochondria-dependent apoptosis through mitochondrial division. However, little is known about the mechanism by which Drp1 modulates apoptosis in response to chlorpyrifos CPF-induced toxicity. In this study, we determined that CPF-induced mitochondrial apoptosis is mediated by Drp1 translocation in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Our results showed that CPF treatment induced intrinsic apoptosis by activating caspase-9, caspase-3, and cytochrome c release in SH-SY5Y cells. Cytosolic Drp1 translocated to the mitochondria in CPF-treated cells and was phosphorylated at Ser616. Treating cells with CPF induced the generation of reactive oxygen species ROS and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPKs. Inhibiting this ROS generation and MAPK activation abolished CPF-induced expression of phospho-Drp1. Furthermore, Drp1 was required for p53 to translocate to the mitochondria under CPF-induced oxidative stress. Treating cells with mitochondrial-division inhibitor-1 mdivi-1, which blocks Drp1 translocation, increased the viability of CPF-treated cells by abrogating Drp1 translocation and caspase-3 activation. Specifically, pretreating cells with mdivi-1 inhibited Bax translocation to the mitochondria by blocking p53 signaling. Taken together, these data reveal a novel mechanism by which Drp1 activates mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis and indicate that inhibiting Dpr1 function can protect against CPF-induced cytotoxicity. We propose that inhibiting Drp1 is a possible therapeutic approach for pesticide-induced toxicity when hyperactivated Drp1 contributes to pathology."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"The placenta and trophoblasts express several B-esterases. This family includes acethylcholinesterase AChE, carboxylesterase CES and butyrylcholinesterase BChE, which are important targets of organophosphate insecticide OP toxicity. To better understand OP effects on trophoblasts, B-esterase basal activity and kinetic behavior were studied in JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cell cultures. Effects of the OP azinphos-methyl Am and chlorpyrifos Cp on cellular enzyme activity were also evaluated. JEG-3 cells showed measurable activity levels of AChE and CES, while BChE was undetected. Recorded Km for AChE and CES were 0.33 and 0.26 mM respectively. Native gel electrophoresis and RT-PCR analysis demonstrated CES1 and CES2 isoform expression. Cells exposed for 4 and 24 h to the OP Am or Cp, showed a differential CES and AChE inhibition profiles. Am inhibited CES and AChE at 4 h treatment while Cp showed the highest inhibition profile at 24 h. Interestingly, both insecticides differentially affected CES1 and CES2 activities. Results demonstrated that JEG-3 trophoblasts express AChE, CES1 and CES2. B-esterase enzymes were inhibited by in vitro OP exposure, indicating that JEG-3 cells metabolization capabilities include phase I enzymes, able to bioactivate OP. In addition, since CES enzymes are important for medicinal drug activation/deactivation, OP exposure may interfere with trophoblast CES metabolization, probably being relevant in a co-exposure scenario during pregnancy."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"OBJECTIVE Organophosphorus OP compounds are used to control pests, however they can reach the food chain and enter the human body causing serious health problems by means of acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition and oxidative stress OS. Among the OPs, chlorpyrifos CHP, malathion MAL, and diazinon DIA are commonly used for commercial extermination purposes, in addition to veterinary practices, domestic, agricul- ture and public health applications. Two new recently registered medicines that contain selenium and other antioxidants, IMOD and angipars ANG, have shown beneficial ef- fects for OS related disorders. This study examines the effect of selenium-based medi- cines on toxicity of three common OP compounds in erythrocytes.   MATERIALS AND METHODS In the present experimental study, we determined the ef- ficacy of IMOD and ANG on OS induced by three mentioned OP pesticides in human erythrocytes in vitro. After dose-response studies, AChE, lipid peroxidation LPO, total antioxidant power TAP and total thiol molecules TTM were measured in eryth- rocytes after exposure to OPs alone and in combined treatment with IMOD or ANG.   RESULTS AChE activity, TAP and TTM reduced in erythrocytes exposed to CHP, MAL and DIA while they were restored in the presence of ANG and IMOD. ANG and IMOD reduced the OPs-induced elevation of LPO.   CONCLUSION The present study shows the positive effects of IMOD and ANG in re- duction of OS and restoration of AChE inhibition induced by CHP, MAL and DIA in erythrocytes in vitro."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Organophosphates e.g. chlorpyrifos ethyl and carbamates e.g. fenobucarb are commonly used to control a wide range of pests in rice fields of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. This study assesses the combined effect of chlorpyrifos ethyl CPF and fenobucarb F, applied at concentrations used by rice farmers, on the brain acetylcholinesterase AChE activity in climbing perch fingerlings from rice fields in the Mekong Delta. It also investigates if Pyridine-2-aldoxime methiodide 2-PAM can be used to reactivate cholinesterase that has been blocked by CPF. Three days after spraying, the water concentrations of both insecticides decreased quickly below the detection levels. However, the brain AChE activity in fish was inhibited for more than 7 days. The results indicate a quicker but less prolonged inhibition of the brain AChE activity by the mixture than by only CPF. The inhibition levels were above 70  only during the first 48 h, which could explain why all fish survived. 2-PAM resulted in a significant reactivation of the cholinesterase blocked by a combination of CPF and F, and it is proposed that the reactivation by 2-PAM could provide a way to assess the AChE inhibition levels in organisms, when no unexposed individuals are available as controls. The results indicate that the current use of CPF and F in rice farming in the Mekong Delta is likely to cause negative effects on non-target organisms. Many of these effects may be sub-lethal, and there is a need to develop biomarkers that are relevant, inexpensive and easy to apply. The results show that brain AChE in climbing perch fingerling is a relevant biomarker for monitoring of exposure to, and sub-lethal impacts from organophosphates and carbamates under tropical conditions in developing countries."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"The internal concentration of chemicals in exposed organisms changes over time due to absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion processes since chemicals are taken up from the environment. Internal concentration and time are very important modifiers of toxicity when biomarkers are used to evaluate the potential hazards and risks of environmental pollutants. In this study, the responses of molecular biomarkers, and the fate of chemicals in the body, were comprehensively investigated to determine cause-and-effect relationships over time. Chlorpyrifos CP was selected as a model chemical, and Caenorhabditis elegans was exposed to CP for 4 h using the passive dosing method. Worms were then monitored in fresh medium during a 48-h recovery regime. The mRNA expression of genes related to CYP metabolism cyp35a2 and cyp35a3 increased during the constant exposure phase. The body residue of CP decreased once it reached a peak level during the early stage of exposure, indicating that the initial uptake of CP rapidly induced biotransformation with the synthesis of new CYP metabolic proteins. The residual chlorpyrifos-oxon concentration, an acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibitor, continuously increased even after the recovery regime started. These delayed toxicokinetics seem to be important for the extension of AChE inhibition for up to 9 h after the start of the recovery regime. Comprehensive investigation into the molecular initiation events and changes in the internal concentrations of chemical species provide insight into response causality within the framework of an adverse outcome pathway."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"OBJECTIVE Chlorpyrifos CPF is a neurotoxic organophosphorus OP insecticide. Its mechanism of action includes oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme AChE. The aim of the present study is to investigate CPF toxicity in mature and immature cerebellar granule neurons CGNs, as well as its effect on glutamate induced excitotoxicity.   MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was an in vitro experimental study performed on mice cultured CGNs. Immature and mature neurons were exposed to different concentrations of CPF 1-1000 M and glutamate 10-600 M for 48 hours after which we used the MTT assay to measure cytotoxicity. Immature neurons had exposure to CPF for 5 days in order to evaluate the cytotoxic effect on developing neurons. Mature neurons received sub-lethal concentrations of CPF 10, 100 M combined with different concentrations of glutamate. AChE activity and reactive oxygen species ROS generation were assessed after treatments.   RESULTS Immature CGNs had increased sensitivity to CPF toxicity compared to mature neurons. We observed significantly greater ROS production in immature compared to mature neurons, however AChE activity was more inhibited in mature neurons. Although CPF toxicity was not well correlated with AChE inhibition, it correlated well with ROS production. Glutamate toxicity was potentiated by sub-lethal concentration of CPF, however glutamate induced ROS production was not affected. The results suggested that CPF potentiated glutamate toxicity by mechanisms other than oxidative stress.   CONCLUSION CPF toxicity differed in mature and immature neurons. Potentiated glutamate toxicity by CPF implied that CPF exposure might be a risk factor for neurodegenerative disease."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Anticholinesterase insecticides such as organophosphorous OP and carbamates pesticides CB and synthetic pyrethroids SP pesticides commonly co-occur in the environment. This raises the possibility of antagonistic, additive, or synergistic neurotoxicity in exposed organisms. Acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition has been demonstrated to be useful as a biomarker for exposure to OP and CBs in many environments. This study investigated the response of housefly Musca domestica head AChE HF-AChE exposed to five OPs chlorpyrifos CPF, malathion MLT, triazophos TRZ, monocrotophos MCP and profenofos PRF and two CBs carbaryl CRB and carbofuran CBF as individual compounds and as binary mixtures of OPs and CBs under in vitro conditions. In addition, the selected OPs and CBs were evaluated for their toxicity in binary combinations with two SPs deltamethrin DLT and cypermethrin CYP at fixed concentrations of 0.1 and 10g/L. The toxicological interaction of five OPs with two CBs pesticides was evaluated under oxidised and un-oxidised conditions using a toxic unit TU approach and a concentration addition CA model. Pyrethroid combinations were assessed only under oxidised conditions. Since OPs and CBs act by a similar mechanism of inhibition of AChE, a dose additive effect was expected, but not conclusively found. TRZ with either CBF or CRB exhibited synergism under oxidised and un-oxidised conditions but the degree of synergism was stronger under un-oxidised conditions. Additivity was exhibited by CBFMCP, CRBMCP, CRBMLT and CBFMCP under un-oxidised conditions and CRBMCP and CRBCPF under oxidised conditions. Pyrethorids in combination with OPs TRZ, MLT and CPF were highly synergistic. In the present study, we used pure housefly head AChE without any interference of monooxygenase and/or esterase enzyme activities. Therefore these other enzymes were not producing the observed deviations from concentration-addition in the binary combinations between OPs, CBs and SPs. The mechanisms of OP, CB and SP interactions in pesticide mixtures requires further investigation."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos CPF is one of the most widely used insecticides and has been found in both urban and rural water bodies. In this study, we studied variations in the social behavioral patterns, swimming behavior, and brain acetylcholinesterase AChE activity of Japanese medaka exposed to lethal 0.12mg/L and sublethal 0.012mg/L concentrations of CPF after different exposure times. Group behavior performance schooling, shoaling, and solitary was determined on day 4 of lethal exposure and on days 4, 8, and 12 of sublethal exposure. Swimming speed and brain AChE activity were measured on days 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 of sublethal CPF exposure. We observed significant decreases in social behavior and swimming speed i.e., hypoactivity in fish exposed to lethal CPF concentrations for 4 days. At the sublethal concentration, there was increased schooling duration and hyperactivity of fish on day 8 but not on day 4. In contrast, 12 days of sublethal CPF exposure resulted in social behavior responses similar to those after 4 days lethal exposure, i.e., significant decreases in schooling frequency and duration with a notable increase in duration of solitary behavior. Brain AChE activity was inhibited in a time-dependent manner. Altered fish behavior in response to organophosphorus pesticides such as CPF may be mediated by more than AChE inhibition alone."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"chlorpyrifos CPF is an organophosphate insecticide used to control pests on a variety of food and feed crops. In mammals, maternal exposure to CPF has been reported to induce cerebral cortex thinning, alteration of long-term brain cognitive function, and Parkinson-like symptoms, but the mechanisms of these processes are not fully understood. In this study, we aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the alterations induced in the brains of mice chronically exposed to CPF by dietary intake. For our purpose, we analysed F1 offspring sacrificed at 3 and 8 months of Mus musculus, treated in utero and postnatally with 3 different doses of CPF 0.1-1-10 mg/kg/day. Using RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays, we evaluated the alterations in the expression of 84 genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases. In the brains of exposed mice, we evidenced a clear dose-response relationship for AChE inhibition and alterations of gene expression. Some of the genes that were steadily down-regulated, such as Pink1, Park 2, Sv2b, Gabbr2, Sept5 and Atxn2, were directly related to Parkinsons onset. Our experimental results shed light on the possibility that long-term CPF exposure may exert membrane signalling alterations which make brain cells more susceptible to develop neurodegenerative diseases."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"BACKGROUND Organophosphorus OP compounds are the most widely used group of insecticides in the world. Risk assessments for these chemicals have focused primarily on 10 inhibition of acetylcholinesterase in the brain as the critical metric of effect. Aside from cholinergic effects resulting from acute exposure, many studies suggest a linkage between cognitive deficits and long-term OP exposure.   OBJECTIVE In this proof-of-concept study, we focused on one of the most widely used OP insecticides in the world, chlorpyrifos CPF, and utilized an existing physiologically based pharmacokinetic PBPK model and a novel pharmacodynamic PD dose-response model to develop a point of departure benchmark dose estimate for cognitive deficits following long-term, low-dose exposure to this chemical in rodents.   METHODS Utilizing a validated PBPK/PD model for CPF, we generated a database of predicted biomarkers of exposure and internal dose metrics in both rat and human. Using simulated peak brain CPF concentrations, we developed a dose-response model to predict CPF-induced spatial memory deficits and correlated these changes to relevant biomarkers of exposure to derive a benchmark dose specific to neurobehavioral changes. We extended these cognitive deficit predictions to humans and simulated corresponding exposures using a model parameterized for humans.   RESULTS Results from this study indicate that the human-equivalent benchmark dose BMD based on a 15 cognitive deficit as an end point is lower than that using the present threshold for 10 brain AChE inhibition. This predicted human-equivalent subchronic BMD threshold compares to occupational exposure levels determined from biomarkers of exposure and corresponds to similar exposure conditions where deficits in cognition are observed.   CONCLUSIONS Quantitative PD models based on neurobehavioral testing in animals offer an important addition to the methodologies used for establishing useful environmental public health indicators and BMDs, and predictions from such models could help inform the human health risk assessment for chlorpyrifos. https//doi.org/10.1289/EHP1743."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Occupational and environmental exposures to organophosphorus pesticides OPs are associated with increased incidence of asthma and other pulmonary diseases. Although the canonical mechanism of OP neurotoxicity is inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE, it was previously reported that the OP chlorpyrifos CPF causes airway hyperreactivity AHR in guinea pigs at levels that do not inhibit lung or brain AChE. The guinea pig is considered to have inherently hyperresponsive airways, thus, cross-species validation is needed to confirm relevance to humans. Additionally, sex differences in asthma incidence have been demonstrated in the human population, but whether OP-induced AHR is sex-dependent has not been systematically studied in a preclinical model. In this study, 8-week old male and female Sprague Dawley rats were administered CPF at doses causing comparable AChE inhibition in whole lung homogenate 30 mg/kg in males, 7 mg/kg in females, sc prior to assessing pulmonary mechanics in response to electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 7 d or 14 d post-exposure in males, and 24 h or 7 d post-exposure in females. CPF significantly potentiated vagally induced airway resistance and tissue elastance at 7 d post-exposure in males, and at 24 h and 7 d post-exposure in females. These effects occurred independent of significant AChE inhibition in cerebellum, blood, trachealis, or isolated airway, suggesting that AChE independent OP-induced airway hyperreactivity is a cross-species phenomenon. These findings have significant implications for assessing the risk posed by CPF, and potentially other OPs, to human health and safety."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"In the present study, a biosensor was developed for the detection of organophosphorous compounds. Core electrode of a working electrode was obtained by depositing the paste of Gold nanoparticles and Multi-walled Carbon Nanotubes on a gold wire. The acetylcholinesterase enzyme was immobilized on carboxylated Single-walled Carbon Nanotubes and pasted onto a core of electrode followed by coating with a nafion layer to prevent enzyme leaching from the electrode. This electrode was further used as a working electrode in the sensor. This sensor worked on the AChE inhibition mechanism where the signal is inversely proportional to the amount of organophosphorous compounds. The electrocatalytic activity of this sensor was observed at a potential of 0.360 mV. The standardized conditions for this sensor were pH at 7.0, temperature at 30C and response time at less than 10s. The linear working range of this biosensor was 0.1-130 M with the lowest detection limit LOD of 1.9, 2.3, 2.2 and 2.5 nM for Methyl Parathion, Monocrotophos, Chlorpyrifos and Endosulfan, respectively. The biosensor showed excellent reusability upto 55 times and can be stored stably for 2 months."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Acute organophosphate OP poisoning induces well-known signs of toxicosis related to acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition. However, the relationship between acute OP poisoning and the onset of psychiatric disorders remains unclear. Thus, we investigated behavioural and biochemical consequences of acute exposure to the OP chlorpyrifos in male rats and also the effectiveness of the antidotes atropine and pralidoxime on reversing these changes. A sub-lethal dose of commercial chlorpyrifos 20 mg/kg, i.p. elicited signs of acute toxicosis during the first hours after its injection in rats. Twenty-four hours after treatment, this single dose of chlorpyrifos induced a depressive-like behaviour in the rat forced swimming test without impairing locomotor activity. At this time 24 h, chlorpyrifos decreased plasma butyrylcholinesterase BChE activity and hippocampal, striatal and prefrontal cortical AChE activity in rats. The behavioural and biochemical consequences of acute chlorpyrifos poisoning do not seem to be long lasting, since 30 days later they were absent. We evaluated whether these behavioural and biochemical consequences of acute chlorpyrifos treatment would be reversed by the antidotes atropine 10 mg/kg i.p. and/or pralidoxime 40 mg/kg i.p. given 1 h after poisoning. Pralidoxime partially reactivated the AChE activity in the prefrontal cortex, but not in the hippocampus and striatum. Atropine attenuated the depressive-like behaviour induced by chlorpyrifos in rats. Our results suggest that acute chlorpyrifos poisoning induces a transient depressive-like behaviour possible related to hippocampal AChE inhibition. They suggest that treatment with atropine and pralidoxime seems to be insufficient to counteract all the effects of OP acute poisoning, at least in rats."
Chlorpyrifos,caspase-3 activation,"The present study investigated the individual and combined impact of organophosphorus pesticide chlorpyrifos CPF and manganese Mn, a naturally occurring trace metal, on hepatorenal function in adult rats. The four experimental groups namely control, CPF alone 5 mg/kg, Mn alone 10 mg/kg and the co-exposure group consisted of eight rats which were orally gavage for 14 consecutive days. Following sacrifice, the biomarkers of hepatorenal damage, antioxidant enzyme activities, myeloperoxidase MPO activity as well as levels of nitric oxide, reactive oxygen and nitrogen RONS species and lipid peroxidation LPO were analysed spectrophotometrically. Further, the concentration of tumour necrosis factor alpha TNF-, interleukin-1  IL-1 and caspase-3 activity were assessed using ELISA. Results showed that the CPF-induced increase in biomarkers of hepatorenal toxicity were significantly p lt 0.05 alleviated in rats co-expose to CPF and Mn. Moreover, the decrease in antioxidant status as well as the elevation in RONS and LPO were significantly assuaged in rats co-treated with CPF and Mn. In addition, CPF mediated increase in TNF-, IL-1 and caspase-3 activity were significantly diminished in the liver and kidney of rats co-exposed to CPF and Mn. Light microscopic examination evidenced that the severity of histopathological lesions induced by CPF were alleviated in rats co-exposed to CPF and Mn. In conclusion, the results highlight that co-exposure to CPF and Mn in rats assuaged CPF-induced oxidative stress, inflammation and caspase-3 activation in the liver and kidney of the rats."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE activity has been widely used to assess the exposure and effects of anticholinergic environmental contaminants in several species. The aim of this study was to investigate if sublethal concentrations of the organophosphorous pesticide chlorpyrifos CPF, a well-known AChE inhibitor, would also affect cholinesterases ChE in Gibbula umbilicalis and if this inhibition would result in an alteration of its behaviour, in an attempt to link the effects observed at the cellular level with effects at higher levels of ecological relevance. The biochemical properties of ChEs in this species were first characterized through the assessment of different enzymatic forms present in the sea snail, using different substrates and selective inhibitors. The results suggest that G. umbilicalis possess ChEs with characteristics of typical AChE, which should be the main form present. Additionally, in vitro and in vivo effects of CPF on AChE activity were investigated, along with effects on snails behaviour the ability of the snails to move/turn after exposure to the contaminant flipping test. As expected, CPF inhibited AChE activity both in vitro and in vivo conditions. Moreover, the link between AChE activity inhibition and adverse effects on behavioural changes was established AChE inhibition was positively correlated with the flipping test, indicating a mechanistic relationship between the two endpoints determined in in vivo exposures. This study highlights the importance of linking biochemical endpoints such as AChE activity with higher level endpoints like behavioural alterations, increasing the ecological relevance of the effects observed."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"The combination of the organophosphate OP chlorpyrifos CPF and the pyrethroid cypermethrin CPM is commonly marketed as pour-on formulations for the control of sheep lice, ked, and blowflies. CPF irreversibly inhibits acetylcholinesterases AChE, while pyrethroids are not AChE inhibitors. However, combinations of pyrethroids with OPs showed a highly synergistic effect on AChE inhibition. Thus, the aim of the current work was to evaluate in vitro and in vivo the inhibitory potency of both pesticides, alone and in combination with AChE and butyrylcholinesterase BChE activities in sheep blood. In vitro, IC50 values were similar after CPF or CPF plus CPM incubations. The pour-on coadministration of recommended doses of CPF and CPM did not cause a significant inhibition of AChE and BChE in sheep blood. Only slight percentages of inhibition of their catalytic activities were observed when both drugs were given at 4-fold higher dose rates. The lower systemic availability of topical administration of OPs in sheep may help to explain the lower degree of inhibition of blood AChE and BChE in vivo. The results emerged from this research are a further contribution to the knowledge of the risks of implementing higher dosage regimens of OPs-containing antiparasitic formulations."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphorus insecticide that elicits acute toxicity through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE, leading to acetylcholine accumulation and prolonged stimulation of cholinergic receptors throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. Previous studies have indicated that neurodevelopment may also be impaired through alternative pathways, including reduction of cyclic adenosine monophosphate cAMP-catalyzed downstream events. The upstream initiating events that underlie noncholinergic neurological actions of chlorpyrifos and other organophosphorus compounds remain unclear. To investigate the potential role of fatty acid signaling disruption as a mechanism of toxicity, lipid metabolism and fatty acid profiles were examined to identify alterations that may play a critical role in upstream signaling in the central nervous system CNS. Juvenile rainbow trout were treated for 7 days with nominal chlorpyrifos concentrations previously reported to diminish olfactory responses 10, 20, and 40 g/l. Although lethality was noted higher in doses, measured chlorpyrifos concentrations of 1.38 g/l nominal concentration 10 g/l significantly reduced the activity of AChE and two serine lipases, monoacylglycerol lipase, and fatty acid amide hydrolase in the brain. Reductions in lysophosphatidylethanolamines 160, 180, 181, and 226 derived from the phosphatidylethanolamines and free fatty acids palmitic acid 160, linolenic acid 183, eicosadienoic acid 202, arachidonic acid 204, and docosahexaenoic acid 226 were also noted, suggesting that chlorpyrifos inhibited the metabolism of select phospholipid signaling precursors at sublethal concentrations. These results indicate that in addition to AChE inhibition, environmentally relevant chlorpyrifos exposure alters serine lipase activity and lipid metabolites in the trout brain, which may compromise neuronal signaling and impact neurobehavioral responses in aquatic animals."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"We estimated the risk to populations of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha due to chlorpyrifos CH, water temperature WT, and dissolved oxygen concentration DO in 4 watersheds in Washington State, USA. The watersheds included the Nooksack and Skagit Rivers in the Northern Puget Sound, the Cedar River in the Seattle-Tacoma corridor, and the Yakima River, a tributary of the Columbia River. The Bayesian network relative risk model BN-RRM was used to conduct this ecological risk assessment and was modified to contain an acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition pathway parameterized using data from CH toxicity data sets. The completed BN-RRM estimated risk at a population scale to Chinook salmon employing classical matrix modeling runs up to 50-y timeframes. There were 3 primary conclusions drawn from the model-building process and the risk calculations. First, the incorporation of an AChE inhibition pathway and the output from a population model can be combined with environmental factors in a quantitative fashion. Second, the probability of not meeting the management goal of no loss to the population ranges from 65 to 85. Environmental conditions contributed to a larger proportion of the risk compared to CH. Third, the sensitivity analysis describing the influence of the variables on the predicted risk varied depending on seasonal conditions. In the summer, WT and DO were more influential than CH. In the winter, when the seasonal conditions are more benign, CH was the driver. Fourth, in order to reach the management goal, we calculated the conditions that would increase juvenile survival, adult survival, and a reduction in toxicological effects. The same process in this example should be applicable to the inclusion of multiple pesticides and to more descriptive population models such as those describing metapopulations.

Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"We investigated a potential use of a 3D tetraculture brain microphysiological system BMPS for neurotoxic chemical agent screening. This platform consists of neuronal tissue with extracellular matrix ECM-embedded neuroblastoma cells, microglia, and astrocytes, and vascular tissue with dynamic flow and membrane-free culture of the endothelial layer. We tested the broader applicability of this model, focusing on organophosphates OPs Malathion MT, Parathion PT, and Chlorpyrifos CPF, and chemicals that interact with GABA and/or opioid receptor systems, including Muscimol MUS, Dextromethorphan DXM, and Ethanol EtOH. We validated the BMPS platform by measuring the neurotoxic effects on barrier integrity, acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition, viability, and residual OP concentration. The results show that OPs penetrated the model blood brain barrier BBB and inhibited AChE activity. DXM, MUS, and EtOH also penetrated the BBB and induced moderate toxicity. The results correlate well with available in vivo data. In addition, simulation results from an in silico physiologically-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic PBPK/PD model that we generated show good agreement with in vivo and in vitro data. In conclusion, this paper demonstrates the potential utility of a membrane-free tetraculture BMPS that can recapitulate brain complexity as a cost-effective alternative to animal models."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"OBJECTIVES Exposure to chlorpyrifos CPF, a neurotoxic insecticide, is implicated with adverse neurodevelopmental effects in children through noncholinergic mechanisms.   METHODS This review presents qualitative and quantitative evidence in three animal models rodent, zebrafish, and Caenorhabditis elegans, for neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects occurring at CPF doses lower than those inhibiting acetylcholinesterase AChE.   RESULTS CPF treatment in rodents at low noncholinergic doses during neurodevelopment showed behavioral effects, including locomotor activity, neuromotor function NMF, cognition, anxiety, social behavior, and maternal care. Zebrafish and C. elegans, which are transparent during development, allow for detailed analysis of specific systems further, they exhibit neurotoxic effects closely emulating those observed in mammalian pathways. Qualitative results showed concordance among rodents, zebrafish and C. elegans for adverse effects on locomotor activity, NMF, and AChE inhibition. Male rodents had greater sensitivity for effects on locomotor activity than females and exposure during the gestation day 10-14 window showed consistent increases in locomotor activity at low CPF doses 1.0 mg kg-1 day-1. Zebrafish had cognitive and anxiety deficits after CPF treatment at low doses and young adult C. elegans had reproductive dysfunction associated NMF and disruption of the serotonergic pathway. Quantitative data for all three species showed neurobehavioral effects after exposure to CPF doses approximately 2-10-fold below the threshold for AChE inhibition.   CONCLUSIONS Taken together, these findings provided a weight-of-evidence for low-dose CPF neurotoxicity and noncholinergic mechanisms. Variability in laboratories, exposure methods, tests, sex, and animal species/strain might have contributed to the inconsistent results. The detrimental CPF effects during early development are relevant to human populations."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"The effects of mixtures of nanoparticles NPs and other chemicals have been poorly studied in terrestrial invertebrates. In this study, we investigated the effects of binary mixtures of goethite -FeOOH NPs and metallic Cd and Pb or organic chlorpyrifos, CPF contaminants in Eisenia andrei earthworms. We used the filter paper contact test to evaluate i the uptake of NPs in organisms exposed to the mixtures of NPsMetals and NPsCPF and ii the potential effects of the mixture of NPsCPF on the CPF-induced inhibition of the biomarker enzymes acetylcholinesterase AChE and carboxylesterases CES. We used the artificial soil test to deepen the study on joint effects of NPsCPF. All compounds were applied separately and in binary mixtures. In the single exposure treatment, Fe levels decreased significantly in organisms exposed to NPs on filter paper, suggesting systemic effects aimed at eliminating Fe incorporated through NPs. Conversely, earthworms exposed to binary mixtures showed Fe levels similar NPsMetals to or higher NPsCPF than controls. The earthworms single exposed to NPs presented no changes in AChE and CES activities. In the artificial soil test, the only treatment that showed AChE inhibition after 72 h was single CPF exposure, while no significant changes were observed in CES activity. However, after 7-day exposure in artificial soil or 72-h exposure on filter paper, the mixture of NPsCPF induced a similar degree of AChE and CES inhibition as single CPF exposure. All these suggested that NPs did not produce neurotoxic effects, and that the inhibition of the enzymes activities in all cases was due to the presence of the pesticide. On the other hand, the differences in the pattern of Fe accumulation in the earthworms indicate that the presence of other contaminants in the exposure media can modify the uptake and/or the excretion of Fe and evidence the interactions that may be found in binary mixtures of metal oxide NPs and other pre-existing contaminants in the soil ecosystem."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Organophosphorus pesticides induce gender-specific developmental neurotoxicity after birth, especially in adolescents and adults. However, whether and when the selectivity occurs in fetus remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed chlorpyrifos CPF-induced neurotoxicity in the early fetal brains of male and female mice. The gestational dams were administered 0, 1, 3, and 5 mg/kg.d CPF during gestational days GD7-11, and brains from the fetuses were isolated and analyzed on GD12. Fetal gender was identified by PCR technique based on male-specific Sry gene and Myog control gene. The body weight and head weight, the activity of acetylcholinesterase AChE, superoxide dismutase SOD, catalase CAT, glutathione peroxidase GPX, and the content of malondialdehyde MDA, as well as the oxidative stress-related gene expression were examined. Our results showed that CPF pretreatment induced AChE inhibition in GD12 fetal brain. CPF treatment activated SOD and GPX but not CAT and MDA. For oxidative stress-related gene expression, CPF pretreatment increased mRNA expression of Sod1, Cat, Gpx1, and Gpx2 in the fetal brain on GD12. The statistical analysis did not show gender-selective CPF-induced toxicity. Moreover, our results showed that although the gestational exposure to CPF could elicit abnormalities in the early fetal brain, the toxicity observed was not gender-specific."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"USEPA assessed whether epidemiology data suggest that fetal or early-life chlorpyrifos exposure causes neurodevelopmental effects and, if so, whether they occur at exposures below those causing the current most sensitive endpoint, 10 inhibition of blood acetylcholinesterase AChE. We previously conducted a hypothesis-based weight-of-evidence analysis and found that a proposed causal association between chlorpyrifos exposure and neurodevelopmental effects in the absence of AChE inhibition does not have a substantial basis in existing animal or in vitro studies, and there is no plausible basis for invoking such effects in humans at their far lower exposure levels. The epidemiology studies fail to show consistent patterns the few associations are likely attributable to alternative explanations. Human data are inappropriate for a dose-response assessment because biomarkers were only measured at one time point, may reflect exposure to other pesticides, and many values are at or below limits of quantification. When considered with pharmacokinetic data, however, these biomarkers provide information on exposure levels relative to those in experimental studies and indicate a margin of exposure of at least 1,000. Because animal data take into account the most sensitive lifestages, the use of AChE inhibition as a regulatory endpoint is protective of adverse effects in sensitive populations."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"This study assessed the in vitro and in vivo effects of an acetylcholinesterase enzyme inhibitor chlorpyrifos in two estuarine crustaceans grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio and mysid Americamysis bahia. The differences in response were quantified after lethal and sublethal exposures to chlorpyrifos and in vitro assays with chlorpyrifos-oxon. Results from the in vitro experiments indicated that the target enzyme, acetylcholinesterase AChE, in the two species was similar in sensitivity to chlorpyrifos inhibition with IC50s of 0.98 nM and 0.89 nM for grass shrimp and mysids, respectively. In vivo experiments showed that mysids were significantly more sensitive to chlorpyrifos-induced AChE inhibition after 24 h of exposure. The in vivo EC50s for AChE inhibition were 1.23 g L-1 for grass shrimp and 0.027 g L-1 for mysids. Median lethal concentrations 24h LC50 values were 1.06 g L-1 for grass shrimp and 0.068 g L-1 for mysids. The results suggest that differences in the response of these two crustaceans are likely related to differences in uptake and metabolism rather than target site sensitivity."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Mixtures of organophosphate OP and carbamate CB insecticides are commonly detected in freshwater habitats. These insecticides inhibit the activity of acetylcholinesterase AChE and have potential to interfere with behaviors that may be essential for survival of species. Although the effects of individual anticholinesterase insecticides on aquatic species have been studied for decades, the combined toxicity of mixtures is still poorly understood. In the present study, we assessed whether pesticides in a mixture act in isolation resulting in additive AChE inhibition or whether components interact to produce either antagonistic or synergistic toxicity. Brain AChE inhibition in carp Cyprinus carpio L. exposed to a series of concentrations of the OP chlorpyrifos, malathion and triazophos as well as the CB fenobucarb and carbosulfan were measured. The concentration addition CA model and the isobole method were used to determine whether toxicological responses to binary mixtures of pesticides. In 5050  effect mixtures, the observed combined toxicity of chlorpyrifos and malathion was significantly higher than observed and was considered as synergistic. For equivalent dose mixtures, when chlorpyrifos mixed with fenobucarb or malathion, the observed toxicities were significantly higher than predicted, suggesting synergistic joint actions. The rest five binary combinations exhibited concentration additive or slight antagonistic joint actions. The CA model and the isobole method provided estimates of mixture toxicity that did not markedly underestimate the measured toxicity, therefore these methods are suitable to use in ecological risk assessments of pesticide mixtures."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"In fish, a number of studies have linked acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition with exposure to organophosphate pesticides OPs however, evidence suggests the need to study aspects related to the bioactivation and detoxification of OPs, since their neurotoxicity is dependent on these processes. Thus, the study aim was to examine the relations between chlorpyrifos CPF and diazinon DZN bioactivation by hepatic CYP450 izoenzymes CYP 2B6, CYP 2C19, CYP 3A4 and detoxification by aryl esterases and oxonases with brain and muscle AChE activity in Chirostoma jordani from three lakes with low to high OPs contamination in water and sediments. We found two patterns of bioactivation in vitro i in fish from a lake with high CPF pollution, the main isoenzymes involved in this process were CYP 2C19gtCYP 2B6gtCYP 3A4, and ii in fish captured in a lake with a high concentration of DZN, the isoenzymes were CYP 3A4gtCYP 2C19gtCYP 2B6. Bioactivation is shown in this study to be fundamental in brain and muscle AChE inhibition in vivo. The rate of bioactivation of CPF was lower than for DZN. CPF bioactivation was accompanied by reduced detoxification and higher neurotoxicity, which was inversely dependent on the environmental contamination of CPF. Detoxification was also inversely correlated with environmental contamination by CPF, and was higher with diazoxon than chlorpyrifos-oxon. Oxonases were the most relevant enzymes involved in detoxification. The current findings suggest a series of strategies between the bioactivation and detoxification of OPs that allowed the survival of C. jordani despite of OPs pollution levels."
Chlorpyrifos,caspase-3 activation,"We investigated apoptotic effects and changes in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase G6PD enzyme activity in liver and gill tissues of fish exposed to chlorpyrifos. Three different chlorpyrifos doses 2.25, 4.5 and 6.75 g/L were administrated to rainbow trout at different time intervals 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. Acute exposure to chlorpyrifos showed time dependent decrease in G6PD enzyme activity at all concentrations p lt 0.05. Immunohistochemical results showed that chlorpyrifos caused mucous cell loss in gill tissue and apoptosis via caspase-3 activation in fish. The present study suggested that chlorpyrifos inhibits G6PD enzyme and causes mucous cell loss in gill and apoptosis in gill and liver tissues."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition has been demonstrated to be useful as a biomarker for exposure to organophosphorus OP insecticides in many environments. The objective of this study was to investigate the response of housefly Musca domestica head AChE HF-AChE exposed to five OPs as individual compounds and their binary mixtures under in vitro conditions. To examine the effects of oxidation on OP potency in the HF-AChE system, bromine water was used as an oxidisng agent. With oxidation, the sensitivity of HF-AChE to chlorpyrifos CPF, malathion MLT and triazophos TRZ increased significantly. Monocrotophos MCP and profenofos PRF did not exhibit any significant differences in toxicity under oxidised and un-oxidised conditions. The toxicological interaction of five organophosphorus pesticides was evaluated using the concentration addition model, the combination index-isobologram equation and the toxic unit approach. All three models provided similar predictions for the 10 binary combinations of OPs under oxidised and un-oxidised conditions. In the present study, the antagonistic effects of the binary combination of OPs CPFPRF, CPFMLT, MCPMLT, PRFMLT, MLTTRZ and PRFTRZ were observed under oxidised conditions. This may be due to dispositional and/or receptor antagonism. Most of the binary combinations assayed under un-oxidised conditions exhibited synergistic responses. Triazophos showed very strong synergism in binary combinations with CPF, MCP and PRF un-oxidised conditions. In contrast, under oxidised conditions, only CPFTRZ exhibited synergism. The results obtained indicate differential toxicity of binary combinations of OPs under oxidised and un-oxidised conditions. This information could be a valuable tool in understanding the mechanisms of OPs interactions and the interpretation of future in vivo studies with mixtures of OP insecticides."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos is a widely used organophosphorous pesticide in agriculture and environmental health. Laboratory studies of chlorpyrifos have revealed acute lethal toxicity at very low concentration 96-h LC50 of 0.39 g L-1 to the freshwater snail, Lanistes carinatus. Acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition progressed and reached 52 and 78 of the control after 28-d exposure to 0.09 and 0.29 g L-1 chlorpyrifos, respectively. Catalase CAT, glutathione peroxidase GPx and glutathione-S-transferase GST activities increased in comparison to control group in the first period of exposure 7-21 d, then decreased relative to the control in the second period of exposure 21-28 d. A significant plt0.05 glutathione GSH depletion was observed in snails exposed to 0.09 and 0.29 g L-1 in comparison to the control, whereas malondialdehyde MDA content gradually increased in a dose-dependent manner. This study showed that alterations in antioxidant enzyme activities along with depletion of GSH content and elevation of MDA content can be used as biomarkers in environmental assessment programs."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Organophosphate pesticides cause irreversible inhibition of AChE which leads to neuronal overstimulation and death. Thus, dogma indicates that the target of OP pesticides is AChE, but many authors postulate that these compounds also disturb cellular redox processes, and change the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Interestingly, it has also been reported that oxidative stress plays also a role in the regulation and activity of AChE. The aims of this study were to determine the effects of the antioxidant, vitamin C VC, the oxidant, t-butyl hydroperoxide tBOOH and the organophosphate Chlorpyrifos CPF, on AChE gene transcription and activity in zebrafish embryos after 72h exposure. In addition, oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring antioxidant enzymes activities and transcription, and quantification of total glutathione. Apical effects on the development of zebrafish embryos were also measured. With the exception of AChE inhibition and enhanced gene expression, limited effects of CPF on oxidative stress and apical endpoints were found at this developmental stage. Addition of VC had little effect on oxidative stress or AChE, but increased pericardial area and heartbeat rate through an unknown mechanism. TBOOH diminished AChE gene expression and activity, and caused oxidative stress when administered alone. However, in combination with CPF, only reductions in AChE activity were observed with no significant changes in oxidative stress suggesting the adverse apical endpoints in the embryos may have been due to AChE inhibition by CPF rather than oxidative stress. These results give additional evidence to support the role of prooxidants in AChE activity and expression."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"The high use of pesticides in intensive rice farming in the Mekong Delta constitutes a potential hazard to the environment and to peoples health. Chlorpyrifos ethyl CPF is a commonly used organophosphate OP insecticide, but information about its potential negative impacts on the aquatic environment in the Mekong Delta is scarce. Both acute and subacute toxicity tests were performed in a static nonrenewable system to investigate the effects of CPF on brain acetylcholinesterase AChE activity in native climbing perch fingerlings Anabas testudineus, Bloch, 1972. Environmental parameters, such as dissolved oxygen, water temperature, and pH, were similar to field conditions in the Mekong Delta. In a 96-h lethal concentration LC50 test, fingerlings of climbing perch were randomly exposed to five levels of CPF ranging from 0.8 to 4.5 ppm. Five sublethal levels of CPF 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20  of the 96-h LC50 value were tested to assess the sensitivity and recovery of the brain AChE activity in climbing perch fingerlings exposed to CPF. The results showed that CPF were moderately toxic to climbing perch with a 96-h median LC50 of 1.73 ppm. CPF also caused long-term AChE inhibition with 70  inhibition remaining after 96 h for the four highest test concentrations. The recovery of brain AChE activity in fish placed in CPF-free water was very slow, and after 7 days the brain AChE activity was still significant lower in fish from the four highest concentrations compared with the control. The results from this study indicate that OP insecticides, such as CPF, can have long-lasting sublethal effects on aquatic species in the Mekong Delta."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Acetylcholinesterase AChE is an enzyme responsible for metabolism of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and inhibition of AChE can have therapeutic applications e.g., drugs for Alzheimers disease or neurotoxic consequences e.g., pesticides. A common absorbance-based AChE activity assay that uses 5,5-dithiobis2-nitrobenzoic acid DTNB can have limited sensitivity and be prone to interference. Therefore, an alternative assay was developed, in which AChE activity was determined by measuring fluorescence of resorufin produced from coupled enzyme reactions involving acetylcholine and Amplex Red 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine. The Amplex Red assay was used for two separate applications. First, AChE activity was measured in rat whole blood, which is a biomarker for exposure to AChE inhibitor pesticides. Activity was quantified from a 105-fold dilution of whole blood, and there was a linear correlation between Amplex Red and DTNB assays. For the second application, Amplex Red assay was used to measure AChE inhibition potency in a human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, which is important for assessing pharmacological and toxicological potential of AChE inhibitors including drugs, phytochemicals, and pesticides. Five known reversible inhibitors were evaluated IC50, 7-225 nM, along with irreversible inhibitors chlorpyrifos-oxon ki=1.01 nM-1h-1 and paraoxon ki=0.16 nM-1h-1. Lastly, in addition to inhibition, AChE reactivation was measured in SH-SY5Y cells incubated with pralidoxime chloride 2-PAM. The Amplex Red assay is a sensitive, specific, and reliable fluorescence method for measuring AChE activity in both rat whole blood and cultured SH-SY5Y cells."
Chlorpyrifos,caspase-3 activation,"Household pesticide exposure during pregnancy has been associated with a more than 2-fold increased risk in infant leukemia, and chlorpyrifos CPF is among the most frequently applied insecticides. During early fetal development, liver is a hematopoietic organ with majority of cells being CD34 hematopoietic stem cells CD34HSC. The in utero injury to CD34HSC has been known to underlie the pathogenesis of several blood disorders, often involving rearrangements of the mixed-lineage leukemia MLL gene on 11q23. In this study, we evaluated the leukemogenic potential of CPF in human fetal liver-derived CD34HSC. Specifically, exposure to 10 M CPF led to decrease in viability, inhibition in proliferation and induction of DNA double-strand breaks DSBs and occurrence of MLL rearrangements. In particular, we observed CPF-mediated cell cycle disturbance as shown by G0/G1 arrest, in contrast to etoposide VP-16, an anticancer drug used as a positive control and known to induce G2/M arrest. Further study on mechanisms underlying DNA DSBs and MLL rearrangements revealed that CPF might act as topoisomerase II poison, a mechanism of action similar to VP-16. On the other hand, CPF was also shown to induce early apoptosis through active caspase-3 activation, a pathway known to underlie DNA DSBs and MLL translocations. Our data indicate that in utero injury of CD34HSC by CPF may contribute to the increased risk of infant leukemia. Future work will elucidate the mechanism and the type of CPF-induced MLL translocations in HSC."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"OBJECTIVE Chlorpyrifos CP as an organophosphorus pesticide is thought to induce oxidative stress in human cells via producing reactive oxygen species ROS that leads to the presence of pathologic conditions due to apoptosis along with acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition.This study aimed to evaluate the apoptotic effects of CP and to assess the protective potential of CeO2nanoparticle CNP and sodium selenite SSe by measuring cascades of apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, and AChE inhibition in human isolated lymphocytes.   MATERIALS AND METHODS In the present experimental study, we examined the anti-oxidative and AChE activating potential of CNP and SSe in CP-treated human lymphocytes. Therefore, the lymphocytes were isolated and exposed to CP, CPCNP, CPSSe, and CPCNPSSe after a three-day incubation. Then tumor necrosis factor-alpha TNF- release, myeloperoxidase MPO activity, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances TBARS levels as inflammatory/oxidative stress indices along with AChE activity were assessed. In addition, the apoptotic process was measured by flow cytometry.   RESULTS Results showed a significant reduction in the mortality rate, TNF-, MPO activity, TBARS, and apoptosis rate in cells treated with CNP, SSe and their combination. Interestingly, both CNP and SSe were able to activate AChE which is inhibited by CP. The results supported the synergistic effect of CNP/SSe combination in the prevention of apoptosis along with oxidative stress and inflammatory cascade.   CONCLUSION CP induces apoptosis in isolated human lymphocytes via oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators. CP firstly produces ROS, which leads to membrane phospholipid damage. The beneficial effects of CNP and SSe in reduction of CP-induced apoptosis and restoring AChE inhibition relate to their anti-oxidative potentials."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos CPF is one of the most widely used organophosphates insecticides that has been reported to induce cognitive disorders both after acute and repeated administration similar to those induced in Alzheimers disease AD. However, the mechanisms through which it induces these effects are unknown. On the other hand, the cholinergic system, mainly basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, is involved in learning and memory regulation, and an alteration of cholinergic transmission or/and cholinergic cell loss could induce these effects. In this regard, it has been reported that CPF can affect cholinergic transmission, and alter AChE variants, which have been shown to be related with basal forebrain cholinergic neuronal loss. According to these data, we hypothesized that CPF could induce basal forebrain cholinergic neuronal loss through cholinergic transmission and AChE variants alteration. To prove this hypothesis, we evaluated in septal SN56 basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, the CPF toxic effects after 24h and 14 days exposure on neuronal viability and the cholinergic mechanisms related to it. This study shows that CPF impaired cholinergic transmission, induced AChE inhibition and, only after long-term exposure, increased CHT expression, which suggests that acetylcholine levels alteration could be mediated by these actions. Moreover, CPF induces, after acute and long-term exposure, cell death in cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and this effect is independent of AChE inhibition and acetylcholine alteration, but was mediated partially by AChE variants alteration. Our present results provide a new understanding of the mechanisms contributing to the harmful effects of CPF on neuronal function and viability, and the possible relevance of CPF in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"A simple and reliable enzymatic system for organophosporus pesticide detection was successfully developed, by exploiting the synergy between the magnetic beads collection capacity and the outstanding electrochemistry property of boron-doped diamond electrodes. The determination of an organophosphate pesticide, chlorpyrifos CPF, was performed based on the inhibition system of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase bonded to magnetic beads through a biotin-streptavidin complex system. A better sensitivity was found for a system with magnetic beads in the concentration range of 10-9 to 10-5 M. The estimated limits of detection based on IC10 10 acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition have been detected and optimized to be 5.7  10-10 M CPF. Spiked samples of water of Yokohama Japan have been measured to validate the efficiency of the enzymatic system. The results suggested that the use of magnetic beads to immobilize biomolecules or biosensing agents is suitable to maintain the superiority of BDD electrodes."
Chlorpyrifos,estrogen receptor activity,"Endocrine disruptors EDs are compounds that interfere with hormone regulation and influence mammary carcinogenesis. We have previously demonstrated that the pesticide chlorpyrifos CPF acts as an ED in vitro, since it induces human breast cancer cells proliferation through estrogen receptor alpha ER pathway. In this work, we studied the effects of CPF at environmental doses 0.01 and 1mg/kg/day on mammary gland, steroid hormone receptors expression and serum steroid hormone levels. It was carried out using female Sprague-Dawley 40-days-old rats exposed to the pesticide during 100 days. We observed a proliferating ductal network with a higher number of ducts and alveolar structures. We also found an increased number of benign breast diseases, such as hyperplasia and adenosis. CPF enhanced progesterone receptor PgR along with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen PCNA in epithelial ductal cells. On the other hand, the pesticide reduced the expression of co-repressors of estrogen receptor activity REA and SMRT and it decreased serum estradiol E2, progesterone Pg and luteinizing hormone LH levels. Finally, we found a persistent decrease in LH levels among ovariectomized rats exposed to CPF. Therefore, CPF alters the endocrine balance acting as an ED in vivo. These findings warn about the harmful effects that CPF exerts on mammary gland, suggesting that this compound may act as a risk factor for breast cancer."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Organophosphate flame retardants OPFRs have been detected at high concentrations in various environmental and biotic samples, but little is known about their toxicity. In this study, the potential neurotoxicity of three OPFRs TCEP, TDCPP, and TPP and Chlorpyrifos CPF, an organophosphate pesticide were compared in Chinese rare minnow using an acute toxicity test and a 21-day fish assay. The acute test demonstrated significant inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE and butyrylcholinesterase BChE by CPF. Although significant AChE inhibition at high concentration of TPP was also observed, none of the OPFRs had effects similar to CPF on these enzymes, indicating that their acute toxicities to Chinese rare minnow may be unrelated to cholinesterase inhibition. In addition, the 21-day fish assay with TDCPP demonstrated no significant effects on cholinesterase activities or neurotransmitter levels. Nonetheless, this OPFR exhibited widespread effects on the neurotrophic factors and their receptors e.g., ntf3, ntrk1, ntrk2, ngfr, and fgf2, fgf11, fgf22, fgfr4, indicating that TDCPP or other OPFRs may elicit neurological effects by targeting neurotrophic factors and their receptors in Chinese rare minnow."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides are widely detected in surface waters of the western United States. These chemicals interfere with acetylcholine-mediated synaptic transmission in the nervous systems of fish and other aquatic animals via the inhibition of AChE acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity. Anticholinesterase insecticides commonly co-occur in the environment. This raises the possibility of antagonistic, additive, or synergistic neurotoxicity in exposed fish, including threatened and endangered species of Pacific salmon. We extracted AChE from the olfactory nervous system of chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and investigated the inhibitory effects of organophosphates the oxon derivatives of diazinon, chlorpyrifos, and malathion and carbamates carbaryl and carbofuran, alone and in two-way combinations. We found that the joint toxicity of anticholinesterase mixtures can be accurately predicted from the inhibitory potencies of individual chemicals within a mixture. This indicates that organophosphate and carbamate insecticides are noninteractive in terms of AChE inhibition and that it might be possible to estimate the cumulative neurotoxicity of mixtures by simple dose addition. Because organophosphates and carbamates are likely to have additive effects on the neurobehavior of salmon under natural exposure conditions, ecological risk assessments that focus on individual anticholinesterases might underestimate the actual risk to salmon in watersheds in which mixtures of these chemicals occur."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"INTRODUCTION Chlorpyrifos CPF is a common organophosphate OP insecticide that has been widely used in extensive agriculture as a pesticide. The primary mechanism of acute toxic action of OPs is inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE. However, targets other than AChE have been proposed to contribute to the acute lethal action and side effects of short- or long-term exposure to these compounds. Bekkedal et al. Sci Total Environ 274119-1232001 showed that chronic administration of the OP trimethylolpropane phosphate TMPP reduces the number of schedule-induced polydipsia SIP sessions necessary to induce asymptotic drinking level.   MATERIALS AND METHODS In the present work, rats were injected with 250 mg/kg CPF and 6 months later, its effect on schedule-induced polydipsia was evaluated. In addition, after stable levels of SIP, a pharmacological study was carried out to determine the implication of other systems in the long-term effects of OPs. Finally, these animals were evaluated in a delay discounting task, as a measure of impulsivity.   RESULTS Results indicate that the CPF group gives more licks to obtain the same amount of water than control rats VHC. Moreover, the administration of diazepam produces an increased water intake in the CPF without any observable effect in VHC rats. Data of the delay discounting task show that CPF rats prefer an immediate reward and show a major impulsive choice.   DISCUSSION Taken together, our data confirm and extend the long-term behavioral effects of subcutaneous administration of CPF and point to a role for other systems that, besides AChE inhibition, contribute to the long-term neurotoxicity of CPF."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Four organophosphorus compounds azinphos-methyl, chlorpyrifos, malathion and malaoxon in aqueous solution were degraded by using a 125 W xenon parabolic lamp. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry GC-MS was used to monitor the disappearance of starting compounds and formation of degradation products as a function of time. AChE-thermal lens spectrometric bioassay was employed to assess the toxicity of photoproducts. The photodegradation kinetics can be described by a first-order degradation curve C=C0e-kt, resulting in the following half lives 2.5min for azinphos-methyl, 11.6 min for malathion, 13.3 min for chlorpyrifos and 45.5 min for malaoxon, under given experimental conditions. During the photoprocess several intermediates were identified by GC-MS suggesting the pathway of OP degradation. The oxidation of chlorpyrifos results in the formation of chlorpyrifos-oxon as the main identified photoproduct. In case of malathion and azinphos-methyl the corresponding oxon analogues were not detected. The formation of diethyl dimethoxy-phosphoryl succinate in traces was observed during photodegradation of malaoxon and malathion. Several other photoproducts including trimethyl phosphate esters, which are known to be AChE inhibitors and 1,2,3-benzotriazin-43H-one as a member of triazine compounds were identified in photodegraded samples of malathion, malaoxon, and azinphos-methyl. Based on this, two main degradation pathways can be proposed, both result of the P-S-C bond cleavage taking place at the side of leaving group. The enhanced inhibition of AChE observed with the TLS bioassay during the initial 30 min of photodegradation in case of all four OPs, confirmed the formation of toxic intermediates. With the continuation of irradiation, the AChE inhibition decreased, indicating that the formed toxic compounds were further degraded to AChE non-inhibiting products. The presented results demonstrate the importance of toxicity monitoring during the degradation of OPs in processes of waste water remediation, before releasing it into the environment."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"In order to enhance the enzymatic detoxification rate of organophosphorus OP nerve agents we have searched for more active variants of recombinant mammalian paraoxonase PON1. We have previously identified three key positions in PON1 that affect OP hydrolysis Leu69, Val346 and His115, that significantly enhance the hydrolysis of cyclosarin GF, soman, chlorpyrifos-oxon ChPo, O-isopropyl-O-p-nitrophenylmethylphosphonate IMP-pNP and diisopropyl fluorophosphate DFP. GC/FPD analysis compared to residual AChE inhibition assay displayed stereoselective hydrolysis of GF, soman and IMP-pNP, indicating that wild type PON1 and its variant V346A are more active toward the less toxic P optical isomer. In order to obtain new PON1 variants with reversed stereoselectivity, displaying augmented activity toward the more toxic isomer P- of nerve agents, we synthesized new asymmetric fluorogenic OPs Flu-OPs. Six Flu-OPs were prepared containing either ethyl E, cyclohexyl C or pinacolyl P alkyl radicals attached to methyl-phosphonyl MP moiety analogous to the structure of VX, GF and soman, respectively. The fluorescent moieties are either 3-cyano-4-methyl-7-hydroxy coumarin MeCyC or 1,3-dichloro-7-hydroxy-9,9-dimethyl-9H-acridin-2-one DDAO. The kinetics of AChE and BChE inhibition by these new Flu-OPs display ki values 8.5x104 to 8.5x107 and 5x104 to 2x106M-1min-1, respectively. EMP-MeCyC and EMP-DDAO are the most active inhibitors of AChE whereas CMP-MeCyC and CMP-DDAO are better inhibitors of BChE than AChE, indicating accommodation of bulky cyclohexyl group inside the active site of BChE. PMP-MeCyC and PMP-DDAO are the least active inhibitors of both AChE and BChE. CMP-MeCyC and CMP-DDAO were significantly detoxified only by the five-site mutations PON1 variant L69V/S138L/S193P/N287D/V346A. Degradation kinetics of Flu-OPs measured by increase in absorbance of the released fluorogenic group was fit by a two exponential function, indicating faster hydrolysis of the less toxic optical isomer. Interestingly, wt PON1 caused only 50 degradation of racemic EMP-MeCyC, CMP-MeCyC and CMP-DDAO indicating complete hydrolysis of P isomer. This remarkable stereoselectivity was used for the enzymatic separation of the P- isomer of CMP-MeCyC. The bimolecular rate constant ki for human AChE inhibition by the isolated P- isomer of CMP-MeCyC is five-fold larger than that of its P isomer. The marked preference of wt PON1 toward P stereo-isomer of CMP-MeCyC and CMP-DDAO renders their P- stereo-isomers suitable for the selection of new OP hydrolase variants with reversed stereoselectivity."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"The purpose the present study was to determine if tolerance is developed to all behavioural effects produced by a single high dose of chlorpyrifos CPF. For this, the study was divided in two phases in the first phase, we studied the time course of the effects produced by treatment with a high dose of CPF 250 mg/kg s.c. on rat locomotor activity and anxiety behaviours recorded on an open-field, as well as on AChE inhibition. Results showed that CPF produced a maximum inhibition of AChE 72 of inhibition 2 days after its administration, exhibiting a partial recovery of its activity by day 30 55 of inhibition. On locomotor activity CPF produced a biphasic effect a reduction only on day 2, and an increase on day 30. An anxiolytic-like effect was only observed within 2 and 5 days after CPF treatment. These results indicate that the tolerance has been developed to the behavioural effects produced by s.c. administration of CPF, but with a different time course. In the second phase, since disturbances in cholinergic system might trigger dopaminergic dysfunctions, we tested the locomotor activity following challenge with amphetamine 1mg/kg i.p. at 11 and 30 days after CPF treatment. Data obtained showed that amphetamine produced an increase in total distances and rearing in vehicle and CPF groups on days 11 and 30. However, CPF group exhibited lower increase relative to vehicle group in both days. This effect is independent of the percentage of AChE inhibition and therefore, of change in the cholinergic system. Data are discussed under the light of the adaptative mechanisms underlying the recovery of the cholinergic overstimulation after s.c. exposure to high doses of CPF."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Spraydrift and edge-of-field runoff are important routes of pesticide entry into streams. Pesticide contamination originating from spraydrift usually resides in the water phase, while pesticides in contaminated runoff are to a large extent associated with suspended particles SPs. The effects of two organophosphorous insecticides OPs, chloropyrifos CPF and azinphos-methyl AZP, on acetylcholinesterase AChE activity in rainbow trout were compared between two exposure scenarios, simulating spraydrift- and runoff-borne contamination events in the Lourens River LR, Western Cape, South Africa. NOECs of brain AChE inhibition, determined after 1h of exposure followed by 24h of recovery, were 0.33microgl-1 for aqueous CPF, 200mgkg-1 for SP-associated CPF and 20mgkg-1 for SP-associated AZP at 0.5gl-1 SP. The highest aqueous AZP concentration tested 3.3microgl-1 was without significant effects. Previously reported peak levels of aqueous CPF in the LR approximately 0.2microgl-1 are close to its NOEC this study, suggesting a significant toxicological risk to fish in the LR. By contrast, reported levels of SP-associated OPs in the LR are 20-200-fold lower than their NOECs this study. In a comparative in situ study, trout were exposed for seven days at agricultural LR2, LR3 and upstream reference LR1 sites. No runoff occurred during the study. Brain AChE was significantly inhibited at LR3. However, OP levels at LR3 CPF 0.01microgl-1 AZP 0.14microgl-1 were minor compared to concentrations having effects in the laboratory see above. Additionally, muscle AChE activity was significantly higher in caged trout from LR1 than in animals maintained in laboratory tanks."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Brain acetylcholinesterase AChE activity was evaluated after two different swimming tests in coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch 238 /- 5 g given 96-h exposures to 0, 5, 10, 20, or 40 microg/L of chlorpyrifos. Brain AChE activity decreased in a concentration-dependent manner AChE activities were 81.8, 52.2, 37.3, and 21.3 of control for the 5, 10, 20, and 40 microg/L exposures, respectively, whereas swimming performance was impaired after a threshold of AChE impairment was reached. Specifically, for swimming performance Ucrit measured using the established ramp-Ucrit test duration, 152 /- 8 min, this threshold occurred with AChE activity of 68.5 /- 18.1 of control. For a rapid acceleration test Udeltav, where V represents velocity 27.6 /- 0.8 min, this value was 52.6 /- 15.4 of control. Both swim protocols resulted in similar maximum swim speeds control ramp-Ucrit and Udeltav values of 3.44 /- 0.09 and 3.71 /- 0.13 body lengths/s, respectively, and performance was significantly reduced after 20 and 40 microg/L exposures in both groups ramp-Ucrit values 86.4 and 83.6 , respectively, of control Udeltav values 85.2 and 77.8, rsepectively, of control. Although both tests yielded similar swim speeds, postexercise plasma lactate concentrations were greater for the Udeltav test 11.3 /- 0.6 vs 8.6 /- 0.5 mmol/L, indicating a greater anaerobic effort. This increase was exaggerated after 10 microg/L of chlorpyrifos 14.6 /- 1.3 mmol/L, indicating that anaerobic muscle was used to attain the same speed. Given the threshold relationship between AChE inhibition and swimming performance, coho salmon appear able to maintain integrated swimming activity despite significant impairment of an underlying neurological control mechanism."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"The aim of this study was to characterize cholinesterase ChE activity in Gammarus pulex, an abundant and ecologically relevant species of the European stream environment. Biochemical and pharmacological properties were tested using different substrates acetylthiocholine iodide, propionylthiocholine iodide and butyrylthiocholine iodide and selective inhibitors eserine sulfate, BW284c51 and iso-OMPA. In a second part, the in vitro and in vivo effects of a widely used organophosphorous pesticide, chlorpyrifos, on ChE activity were investigated. The results suggest that G. pulex possess only one ChE which displays the typical properties of an acetylcholinesterase, since 1 it hydrolyses to the substrate acetylthiocholine at a higher rate than all other tested substrates and 2 it is highly sensitive to eserine sulphate and BW284c51, but not to iso-OMPA. In vitro and in vivo inhibitions were observed for highly different contamination levels, which suggests that bioaccumulation and biotransformation mechanisms are involved. In vivo AChE inhibition was observed at realistic environmental concentrations, with lethal effects appearing at inhibitions higher than 50. The results of this study show the value of G. pulex as a sentinel organism for environmental assessment."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"A large number of organophosphorous insecticides OPs are chiral compounds, and yet enantioselectivity in their environmental fate and effects is rarely addressed. In the present study, we isolated individual enantiomers of three OPs, profenofos, fonofos, and crotoxyphos, and evaluated enantioselectivity in their inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE. Acetylcholinesterase inhibition by the enantiomers and racemates was determined in vivo in the aquatic invertebrate Daphnia magna and in Japanese medaka Oryzias latipes as well as in vitro with electric eel Electrophorus electricus and human recombinant AChEs. The overall results showed variable sensitivity between AChE enzymes from different species as well as variable magnitude of enantioselectivity in enzyme inhibition. The --enantiomer of profenofos was 4.3- to 8.5-fold more inhibitory to AChE in vivo, whereas --fonofos was 2.3- to 29-fold more potent than the corresponding -enantiomer. The -enantiomer of crotoxyphos was 1.1- to 11-fold more inhibitory to AChE than the --enantiomer. In contrast, the in vitro results showed -profenofos to be 2.6- to 71.8-fold more inhibitory than the --enantiomer and --crotoxyphos to be 1.6- to 1.9-fold more active than the -enantiomer. The reversed direction of enantioselectivity observed between the in vivo and in vitro assays suggests enantioselectivity within toxicodynamic processes such as uptake, biotransformation, or elimination. Findings from the present study provide evidence of enantioselectivity in the AChE inhibition of chiral OPs in nontarget organisms and indicate the need to consider enantiomers individually when assessing environmental risk of these chiral pesticides."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Dimethoate DIM is an organophosphorothionate OPT pesticide used worldwide as a systemic insecticide and acaricide. It is characterized by low-to-moderate acute mammalian toxicity similarly to the other OPT pesticides, its mode of action is mediated by the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE, exerted by its toxic metabolite dimethoate-oxon or omethoate OME, which is also used as a direct acting pesticide. Human hepatic DIM bioactivation to the toxic metabolite OME has been characterized by using c-DNA expressed human CYPs and human liver microsomes HLM also in the presence of CYP-specific chemical inhibitors, with a method based on AChE inhibition. The obtained kinetic parameters and AChE IC50 have been compared with those previously obtained with other OPTs, indicating a lower efficiency in DIM desulfuration reaction and a lower potency in inhibiting AChE. Results showed that, similarly to the other OPTs tested so far, at low DIM concentration OME formation is mainly catalysed by CYP1A2, while the role of 3A4 is relevant at high DIM levels. Differently from the other OPTs, DIM desulfuration reaction showed an atypical kinetic profile, likely due to CYP3A4 autoactivation. The sigmoidicity degree of the activity curve increased with the level of CYP3A4 in HLM or disappeared in the presence of a CYP3A4 chemical inhibitor. This atypical kinetic behaviour can be considered one of the possible explanations for the recent findings that among patients hospitalized following OPT intoxication, DIM ingestion gave different symptoms and more severe poisoning 23.1 of fatal cases versus total than chlorpyrifos 8 of deaths, which has a lower LD50 value. Since DIM-poisoned patients poorly responded to pralidoxime, the possibility to use CYP3A4 inhibitors could be considered as a complementary treatment."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"We have evaluated the potential of plasma albumin to provide a sensitive biomarker of exposure to commonly used organophosphorus pesticides in order to complement the widely used measure of acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition. Rat or human plasma albumin binding by tritiated-diisopropylfluorophosphate 3H-DFP was quantified by retention of albumin on glass microfibre filters. Preincubation with unlabelled pesticide in vitro or dosing of F344 rats with pesticide in vivo resulted in a reduction in subsequent albumin radiolabelling with 3H-DFP, the decrease in which was used to quantify pesticide binding. At pesticide exposures producing approximately 30 inhibition of AChE, rat plasma albumin binding in vitro by azamethiphos oxon, chlorfenvinphos oxon, chlorpyrifos-oxon, diazinon-oxon and malaoxon was reduced from controls by 9/-1, 67/-2, 56/-2, 54/-2 and 8/-1, respectively. After 1 h of incubation with 19 microM 3H-DFP alone, the level of binding to rat or human plasma albumins reached 0.011 or 0.039 moles of DFP per mole of albumin, respectively. This level of binding could be further increased by raising the concentration of 3H-DFP, increasing the 3H-DFP incubation time, or by substitution of commercial albumins for native albumin. Pesticide binding to albumin was presumed covalent since it survived 24 h dialysis. After dosing rats with pirimiphos-methyl dimethoxy or chlorfenvinphos oxon diethoxy pesticides, the resultant albumin binding were still significant 7 days after dosing. As in vitro, dosing of rats with malathion did not result in significant albumin binding in vivo. Our results suggest albumin may be a useful additional biomonitor for moderately low-level exposures to several widely used pesticides, and that this binding differs markedly between pesticides."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"BACKGROUND Mixtures of organophosphate and carbamate pesticides are commonly detected in freshwater habitats that support threatened and endangered species of Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus sp.. These pesticides inhibit the activity of acetylcholinesterase AChE and thus have potential to interfere with behaviors that may be essential for salmon survival. Although the effects of individual anticholin-esterase insecticides on aquatic species have been studied for decades, the neurotoxicity of mixtures is still poorly understood.   OBJECTIVES We assessed whether chemicals in a mixture act in isolation resulting in additive AChE inhibition or whether components interact to produce either antagonistic or synergistic toxicity.   METHODS We measured brain AChE inhibition in juvenile coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch exposed to sublethal concentrations of the organophosphates diazinon, malathion, and chlorpyrifos, as well as the carbamates carbaryl and carbofuran. Concentrations of individual chemicals were normalized to their respective median effective concentrations EC50 and collectively fit to a nonlinear regression. We used this curve to determine whether toxicologic responses to binary mixtures were additive, antagonistic, or synergistic.   RESULTS We observed addition and synergism, with a greater degree of synergism at higher exposure concentrations. Several combinations of organophosphates were lethal at concentrations that were sublethal in single-chemical trials.   CONCLUSION Single-chemical risk assessments are likely to underestimate the impacts of these insecticides on salmon in river systems where mixtures occur. Moreover, mixtures of pesticides that have been commonly reported in salmon habitats may pose a more important challenge for species recovery than previously anticipated."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Relations between whole-body acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition and changes in feeding and locomotor behaviours were investigated in adult male Gammarus fossarum during short-term exposure 96h to the organophosphorous pesticide chlorpyrifos CPE and the carbamate pesticide methomyl MT. AChE activity was measured after 24, 48 and 96h of exposure. The feeding rate was assessed after 48 and 96h of exposure and locomotor activity was measured at the end of the experiment. A concentration-dependent decrease of AChE activity and behavioural parameters was observed for both CPE and MT. However, these two compounds presented dissimilar modes of action since MT-induced effects appeared rapidly during the first 48h of the experiment and remained constant until the end of experiment, contrary to CPE-induced effects, which occurred gradually during the last 48h. For CPE, significant mortality was observed from 50 AChE inhibition, contrary to MT for which no mortality was observed despite 66 inhibition. These results suggest that, for CPE, the observed mortality was not directly related to AChE inhibition but that an additional toxic mode of action occurred. On the contrary, the feeding rate and locomotion impairment were directly correlated to levels of AChE inhibition for both chemicals, except for the lowest concentrations of MT for which an induction of the behavioural parameters was observed. Although CPE and MT have different modes of action acting as indirect and direct inhibitors, the relations between AChE activity and inhibition of behavioural parameters were relatively close for these two compounds. This study provides a basis to interpret the biomarker AChE at the upper biological organisation level, on both the feeding rate and locomotor behaviour, which are known to be relevant ecological responses."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"The present study investigates the occurrence of acetylcholinesterase AChE-inhibiting organophosphorus OP pesticide residues in milled rice samples obtained form local markets in China during the period 2004-2006 and estimates their cumulative exposure. Concentrations of OP pesticides were determined by gas chromatography with flame photometric detection GC-FPD. The results showed that 9.3 of the samples contained detectable residues of at least one of the seven target OP pesticides chlorpyrifos, dichlorvos, omethoate, methamidophos, parathion-methyl, parathion and triazophos mainly used for agriculture in China, with concentrations ranging 0.011-1.756 mg kg-1. Rice consumption data was obtained from an individual food consumption survey. Relative potency factors RPFs for each pesticide were calculated with methamidophos as the index compound IC, using 1- or 2-year chronic non-observed adverse effect levels NOAEL for AChE inhibition, mostly in rat brain, obtained from international evaluations of pesticides. Exposure to AChE-inhibiting pesticides for the population above 7 years old at P99.9 represented 52-94.5 of the acceptable daily intake ADI expressed as methamidophos. Estimated exposure for children aged 2-4 and 4-7 years at P99.9 were 119 and 104.3 of the ADI level, respectively. This study suggests that a yearly monitoring program for OP pesticide residues and strict implementation of the national safety standard for milled rice is necessary."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos CPF is an organophosphorus insecticide that has gained significant attention cue to the reported toxicity associated with developmental exposure. While the canonical mechanism of toxicity of CPF involves the inhibition of brain acetylcholinesterase AChE, we have reported that exposure of juvenile rats to levels of CPF that do not yield any inhibition of brain AChE results in neurobehavioral alterations at later ages. However, it is unclear what effect exposure to these low levels of CPF has on blood esterase activities which are frequently used not only as biomarkers of exposure but also to set exposure levels in risk assessment. To determine this, male and female rat pups were exposed orally from postnatal day 10 to 16 to either corn oil vehicle or 0.5, 0.75, or 1.0 mg/kg CPF. At 12 h after the final exposure, serum cholinesterase ChE, butyrylcholinesterase BChE, and carboxylesterase CES, and red blood cell RBC and brain AChE activities were determined. There were no differences between sexes in either the controls or individual treatments for all enzymes. Only the highest dosage of 1.0 mg/kg CPF yielded significant brain AChE inhibition 22-24 but all dosages significantly inhibited the blood esterases with inhibition being highest with serum CES 65-85 followed by serum BChE 57-76, RBC AChE 35-65, and then serum ChE 16-32. Our data verify that blood esterases are inhibited at dosages of CPF that alter neurobehavioral performance in the absence of effects on brain AChE activity."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"The acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition assay has been frequently applied for environmental monitoring to capture insecticides such as organothiophosphates OTPs and carbamates. However, natural organic matter such as dissolved organic carbon DOC co-extracted with solid-phase extraction from environmental samples can produce false-negative AChE inhibition in free enzyme-based AChE assays. We evaluated whether disturbance by DOC can be alleviated in a cell-based AChE assay using differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. The exposure duration was set at an optimum of 3 h considering the effects of OTPs and carbamates. Because loss to the airspace was expected for the more volatile OTPs chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and parathion, the chemical loss in this bioassay setup was investigated using solid-phase microextraction followed by chemical analysis. The three OTPs were relatively well retained loss lt34 during 3 h of exposure in the 384-well plate, but higher losses occurred on prolonged exposure, accompanied by slight cross-contamination of adjacent wells. Inhibition of AChE by paraoxon-ethyl was not altered in the presence of up to 68 mgc /L Aldrich humic acid used as surrogate for DOC. Binary mixtures of paraoxon-ethyl and water extracts showed concentration-additive effects. These experiments confirmed that the matrix in water extracts does not disturb the assay, unlike purified enzyme-based AChE assays. The cell-based AChE assay proved to be suitable for testing water samples with effect concentrations causing 50 inhibition of AChE at relative enrichments of 0.5-10 in river water samples, which were distinctly lower than corresponding cytotoxicity, confirming the high sensitivity of the cell-based AChE inhibition assay and its relevance for water quality monitoring.

Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Organophosphorus pesticides OPs are a chemically diverse class of insecticides that inhibit acetylcholinesterase AChE. Many OPs require bioactivation to their active oxon form via cytochrome P450 to effectively inhibit AChE. OP toxicity can be mitigated by detoxification reactions performed by carboxylesterase and paraoxonase. The relative extent of bioactivation to detoxification varies among individuals and between species, leading to differential susceptibility to OP toxicity. Because of these species differences, it is imperative to characterize OP metabolism in model systems used to assess OP toxicity. We have shown that the asexual freshwater planarian Dugesia japonica is a suitable model to assess OP neurotoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity via rapid, automated testing of adult and developing organisms in parallel using morphological and behavioral endpoints. D. japonica has two cholinesterase enzymes with intermediate properties between AChE and butyrylcholinesterase that are sensitive to OP inhibition. Here, we demonstrate that D. japonica contains the major OP metabolic machinery to be a relevant model for OP neurotoxicity studies. Adult and regenerating D. japonica can bioactivate chlorpyrifos and diazinon into their respective oxons. Significant AChE inhibition was only observed after in vivo metabolic activation but not when the parent OPs were directly added to planarian homogenate using the same concentrations and timing. Using biochemical assays, we found that D. japonica has both carboxylesterase 24 nmol/minmg protein and paraoxonase 60 pmol/minmg protein activity. We show that planarian carboxylesterase activity is distinct from cholinesterase activity using benzil and tacrine. These results further support the use of D. japonica for OP toxicity studies."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Organophosphorus pesticides OPs are a chemically diverse class of commonly used insecticides. Epidemiological studies suggest that low dose chronic prenatal and infant exposures can lead to life-long neurological damage and behavioral disorders. While inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE is the shared mechanism of acute OP neurotoxicity, OP-induced developmental neurotoxicity DNT can occur independently and/or in the absence of significant AChE inhibition, implying that OPs affect alternative targets. Moreover, different OPs can cause different adverse outcomes, suggesting that different OPs act through different mechanisms. These findings emphasize the importance of comparative studies of OP toxicity. Freshwater planarians are an invertebrate system that uniquely allows for automated, rapid and inexpensive testing of adult and developing organisms in parallel to differentiate neurotoxicity from DNT. Effects found only in regenerating planarians would be indicative of DNT, whereas shared effects may represent neurotoxicity. We leverage this unique feature of planarians to investigate potential differential effects of OPs on the adult and developing brain by performing a comparative screen to test 7 OPs acephate, chlorpyrifos, dichlorvos, diazinon, malathion, parathion and profenofos across 10 concentrations in quarter-log steps. Neurotoxicity was evaluated using a wide range of quantitative morphological and behavioral readouts. AChE activity was measured using an Ellman assay. The toxicological profiles of the 7 OPs differed across the OPs and between adult and regenerating planarians. Toxicological profiles were not correlated with levels of AChE inhibition. Twenty-two ""mechanistic control compounds"" known to target pathways suggested in the literature to be affected by OPs cholinergic neurotransmission, serotonin neurotransmission, endocannabinoid system, cytoskeleton, adenyl cyclase and oxidative stress and 2 negative controls were also screened. When compared with the mechanistic control compounds, the phenotypic profiles of the different OPs separated into distinct clusters. The phenotypic profiles of adult vs. regenerating planarians exposed to the OPs clustered differently, suggesting some developmental-specific mechanisms. These results further support findings in other systems that OPs cause different adverse outcomes in the developing brain and build the foundation for future comparative studies focused on delineating the mechanisms of OP neurotoxicity in planarians."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Gulf War Illness GWI is a chronic illness that affects upward of 32 of deployed Veterans to the 1991 Gulf War GW. The symptoms are medically unexplained, ranging across cognitive deficits, fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, and musculoskeletal pain. Research indicates that chemical warfare agents play a key role in the onset and progression of GWI. The Khamisiyah ammunition storage that housed chemical warfare agents such as sarin, an acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibitor, was demolished during the GW, releasing toxicants into the atmosphere affecting deployed troops. Exposure to other chemical agents such as pyridostigmine bromide, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide, permethrin and chlorpyrifos, were also prevalent during the war. These additional chemical agents have also been shown to inhibit AChE. AChE inhibition induces an acetylcholine build-up, disrupting signals between nerves and muscles, which in high doses leads to asphyxiation. Little is known about low dose exposure. As bioactive compounds tend to interact with multiple proteins with various physiological effect, we aimed to identify other potential shared targets to understand the extent in which these chemicals could lead to GWI. We followed a reverse screening approach where each chemical is computationally docked to a library of protein targets. The programs PharmMapper and TargetNet were used for this purpose, and further analyses were conducted to mark significant changes in participants with GWI. Previously published work on DNA methylation status in GWI was reanalyzed focusing specifically on the predicted shared targets indicating significant changes in DNA methylation of the associated genes. Our findings thus suggest that exposure to GWI-related agents may converge on similar targets with roles in inflammation, neurotransmitter and lipid metabolism, and detoxification which may have impacts on neurodegenerative-like disease and oxidative stress in Veterans with GWI."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"The development of a common and anti-interference acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition assay for plant-originated food samples has been of great challenge because of the prevalent and strong signal interferences from natural pigments. Plant pigments normally exhibit non-negligible absorbance in the UV-visible region. As a result, the signals of a typical near-infrared NIR fluorescent probe could be disturbed through primary inner filter effect if it is excited by UV-visible light during plant sample analysis. In this work, an NIR-excitable AChE-activated fluorescent probe was biomimetically designed and synthesized. And the NIR-excitation strategy was utilized for the anti-interference detection of organophosphate and carbamate pesticides in colored samples with this probe. Sensitive and rapid response to AChE and pesticides was achieved due to the high affinity of the biomimetic recognition unit in the probe. The limits of detection for four representative pesticides including dichlorvos, carbofuran, chlorpyrifos and methamidophos reached 0.0186 g/L, 2.20 g/L, 12.3 g/L and 13.6 g/L, respectively. Most importantly, fluorescent response to pesticide contents could be accurately measured in the coexistence of different plant pigments by this probe, and the measured results showed completely irrelevance to the plant pigments and their colors. Taking advantage of such probe, the new developed AChE inhibition assay showed good sensitivity and anti-interference ability in the detection of organophosphate and carbamate pesticides in real samples."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos 0,0-diethyl 0-3,5,6-trichloro-pyridyl phosphorothioate caused delayed polyneuropathy in man. Contrary to previous studies, we report here that it also causes delayed polyneuropathy in the hen, the animal model for this toxicity. The minimal neuropathic dose was 60-90 mg/kg p.o., corresponding to 4-6 times the estimated LD50. Consequently, pralidoxime 2-PAM in conjunction with atropine was necessary to reverse acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition and cholinergic toxicity in hens given high enough doses of chlorpyrifos to cause neuropathy. Chlorpyrifos was slowly absorbed after single oral doses and the threshold of inhibition greater than 70 of neuropathy target esterase NTE, the putative target for delayed neuropathy, was reached within 5-6 days. High AChE inhibition greater than 90, however, was measured within hours after dosing because of the higher potency of chlorpyrifos to inhibit this enzyme. In vitro studies showed that chlorpyrifos-oxon, the active metabolite of chlorpyrifos, was 10-20 times more active against AChE than against NTE, confirming the clinical observation. No differences were seen between human and hen enzymes in this respect. Hen and human brain homogenates contain A-esterases which hydrolysed chlorpyrifos to about the same extent in both species. In conclusion, chlorpyrifos causes delayed polyneuropathy in the hen, as was reported in man. The reasons for previous negative data in the hen are probably due to the relatively lower doses which were used. Judging from in vitro studies with hen and human enzymes, there are no differences in the two species as far as their relative sensitivity to delayed polyneuropathy. It is likely that delayed polyneuropathy would develop in both species only after severe cholinergic toxicity requiring aggressive antidotal treatment."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Fathead minnows Pimephales promelas were exposed to Dursban during a chronic toxicity test for 200 days including a reproductive period of their life cycle. The fish concentrated Dursban approximately 1700 times. Survival of first-generation fish was adversely affected at 2.68 micrograms/liter within 60 days. A significant increase in deformities occurred at 2.68 micrograms/liter within 30 days. Growth was significantly reduced at 2.68 micrograms/liter within 30 days and at 1.21 micrograms/liter by 60 days. Maturation of the first-generation fish was reduced at all Dursban exposures and reproduction was significantly reduced at 0.63 micrograms/liter and above. Growth and estimated biomass of 30-day-old second-generation fish were significantly reduced at 0.12 micrograms/liter, the lowest concentration tested. Brain acetylcholinesterase AChE activity was significantly inhibited at 0.27 micrograms/liter and above. AChE inhibition ranged from near 10 in fish exposed at 0.12 micrograms/liter to 89 for those exposed at 2.68 micrograms/liter. Inhibition results are compared to other results demonstrated during the chronic study. The use of exposure units exposure concentration X exposure duration is discussed as a tool for determining the effects of organophosphate pesticides on the environment."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Although the acute effects of organophosphorus esters are generally ascribed to inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, work in this laboratory and others indicates that organophosphorus insecticides also interact directly with cholinergic receptors. The current study verifies that the insecticide O,O-diethyl O-3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinyl phosphorothionate chlorpyrifos and its oxon metabolite inhibits acetylcholinesterase AChE. The metabolite inhibits rat brain AChE three orders of magnitude more rapidly than chlorpyrifos. In addition to their ability to inhibit AChE, these compounds were shown to interact directly with muscarinic receptors of rat striatum. The oxon metabolite bound at low concentrations to muscarinic receptors labeled by the muscarinic agonist 3H cis-methyldioxolane chlorpyrifos oxon bound with an IC50 value of 22.1 /- 3.6 nM. The receptors bound by chlorpyrifos oxon account for approximately 30 of muscarinic receptors of the striatum and are of the m2 subtype. The binding of chlorpyrifos oxon to the m2 receptor results in a covalent modification of the receptor that does not interfere with the ability of the receptor to interact with the agonist carbachol. This receptor modification may be responsible for the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity by chlorpyrifos oxon. The oxon inhibited adenylate cyclase with an IC50 of 155 /- 78 nM. The inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity was not blocked by atropine and was additive to that produced by carbachol. The altering of postreceptor signal transduction by chlorpyrifos oxon may interfere with normal cellular signaling, thereby disturbing neurological function. Direct interaction of chlorpyrifos oxon with muscarinic receptors and associated signal transduction is a potential mechanism of neurotoxicity that is independent of AChE inhibition."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos diethyl 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl phosphorothionate is a broad-spectrum organophosphorus OP insecticide. Anticipated increases in the already extensive use of this compound have prompted this reassessment of its neurotoxicity. Because chlorpyrifos and other OP insecticides are designed to produce acute cholinergic effects through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE and some OP compounds can cause OP compound-induced delayed neurotoxicity OPIDN via chemical modification of neurotoxic esterase neuropathy target esterase, NTE, this review focuses on the capacity of chlorpyrifos to precipitate these and other adverse neurological consequences. Chlorpyrifos exhibits only moderate acute toxicity in many mammalian species, due largely to detoxification of the active metabolite, chlorpyrifos oxon, by A-esterases. Rats given large doses of chlorpyrifos sc in oil have prolonged inhibition of brain AChE, possibly due to slow release of the parent compound from a depot. Associated cognitive and motor deficits return to normal well before recovery of AChE activity and muscarinic receptor down-regulation, as expected from classic tolerance. Controlled studies of OP compound exposures in humans also indicate that cognitive dysfunction requires substantial AChE inhibition. Information is relatively sparse on neurological dysfunction that is secondary to theoretical reproductive, developmental, or immunological effects, but the best available data indicate that such effects are unlikely to result from exposures to chlorpyrifos. In accord with the much greater inhibitory potency of chlorpyrifos oxon for AChE than for NTE, clinical reports and experimental studies indicate that OPIDN from acute exposures to chlorpyrifos requires doses well in excess of the LD50, even when followed by repeated doses of the OPIDN potentiator phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride PMSF. Likewise, studies in hens show that subchronic exposures at the maximum tolerated daily dose do not result in OPIDN. Although exposure to chlorpyrifos as a result of normal use is unlikely to produce classical OPIDN, a recent report stated that mild reversible sensory neuropathy had occurred in eight patients who had been exposed subchronically to unknown amounts of chlorpyrifos. It is not clear whether these cases represent an incorrect linkage of cause and effect, a newly disclosed reversible sensory component of OPIDN, or an entirely new phenomenon. The question of the potential for chlorpyrifos to cause this mild sensory neuropathy could be resolved by the use of quantitative tests of sensory function in animal experiments and/or prospective studies of humans with known exposures to chlorpyrifos."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos CPF, an organophosphorus OP insecticide, exerts toxicity through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE. In the present study, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were given CPF 200 mg/kg, sc as a single dose on gestation d 12 GD12 and then sacrificed on either GD16, GD20, or postnatal d 3 PND3 for measurement of maternal and developmental indicators of toxicity. While most CPF-treated rats exhibited no overt signs, a subset 4/28 showed moderate to severe signs of ""cholinergic"" toxicity at 2-3 d after treatment, and these rats were omitted from further studies. Extensive AChE inhibition 82-88 was noted in maternal brain at all three time points following acute exposures. At GD16 and GD20, fetal brain AChE activity was inhibited 42-44. While some degree of recovery in AChE activity was noted in pup brain by PND3, AChE activity was still inhibited 30 in treated pups cross-fostered to control dams. In vitro inhibition of maternal and fetal GD20 brain AChE activity by the active metabolite, chlorpyrifos oxon, suggested that the prenatal brain AChE activity was somewhat more sensitive IC50 at 37.0 degrees C, 20 min dam, 26.6 /- 1.8 x 10-9 M fetus, 6.7 /- 0.4 x 10-9 M. Maternal brain muscarinic receptor binding was more extensively reduced 30-32 at GD20 and PND3 as compared to the developing brain at GD20 16 and PND3 11. A simple postnatal reflex test righting reflex was transiently altered by CPF. The results suggest that CPF exposure to dams during gestation produces more extensive neurotoxicological effects in the dam relative to the developing fetus."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Paraoxonase can hydrolyze paraoxon PO, chlorpyrifos-oxon CPO and other organophosphates. Previous studies have indicated that the levels of serum paraoxonase can influence the toxicity of PO and CPO. In the present study we have investigated whether exogenous paraoxonase administered to mice would offer protection toward the acute toxicity of a phosphorothioate, chlorpyrifos CPS. Paraoxonase was purified from rabbit serum and injected i.v., or i.v. plus i.p., in mice. Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE in brain, diaphragm, plasma and red blood cells was measured as an index of CPS 100 mg/kg toxicity. Administration of paraoxonase 30 min before CPS increased plasma enzyme activity toward CPO by 35-fold, and protected against its toxicity protection was still present at 24 h, when enzyme activity was still 20-fold over basal. When paraoxonase was given 30 min after CPS, a significant protection against CPS toxicity was still observed, while after 3 h the protective effect was decreased. To mimic conditions of severe acute poisoning, a higher dose of CPS 150 mg/kg was also administered. Administration of paraoxonase 30 min after this exposure abolished cholinergic signs and significantly protected against AChE inhibition. These results indicate that exogenous paraoxonase offers significant protection against CPS toxicity when administered both before and after the organophosphate, suggesting that it may be considered as a potential additional treatment of organophosphate poisoning."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Acute exposure to the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos CPF on gestation day 12 GD12, 200 mg/kg/ml, SC causes extensive neurochemical changes in maternal brain but lesser changes in fetal brain. In the present study, we examined the relative neurotoxicity of repeated, lower-level CPF exposures during gestation in rats. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to CPF 6.25, 12.5, or 25 mg/kg per day, SC from GD12-19 and sampled at either GD16, GD20, or postnatal day 3 PND3 for measurement of various maternal and developmental neurochemical markers. In contrast to the high acute dose exposure, no maternal toxicity was noted with repeated lower-level dosing. Extensive acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition 83-90 was noted in maternal brain at all three time points following repeated exposures 25 mg/kg. Higher AChE inhibition 58 was noted in fetal brain at GD20 compared to 19-25 on PND3 in treated pups cross-fostered to control dams and in control pups cross-fostered to treated dams following repeated exposures 25 mg/kg per day. Whereas similar reductions in brain muscarinic receptor binding were noted at GD20 and PND3 in dams and developing brain between acute and repeated dosing regimens, greater changes in 3HCD and 3Hcytisine binding were evident following repeated exposures. Righting reflex and cliff avoidance tests were markedly altered following repeated exposures. The results suggest that lower-level repeated exposures to CPF cause extensive neurochemical and neurobehavioral changes in developing rats in the absence of maternal toxicity."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"High, subcutaneous doses of the organophosphorus insecticide chlorpyrifos CPF in adult male rats can be well-tolerated despite extensive and persistent acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition. We propose that changes in acetylcholine synthesis could modulate the toxicity associated with extensive AChE inhibition following CPF exposure. High-affinity choline uptake HACU, the rate-limiting step in acetlcholine synthesis and binding to 3H-hemicholinium-3 HC-3, a specific ligand for the choline transporter were chosen as indicators of acetylcholine synthesis. Female, Sprague-Dawley rats 220-280 g were treated with either vehicle peanut oil, 2 ml/kg, sc or CPF 280 mg/kg, 2 ml/kg, sc, examined daily for clinical signs of toxicity, and sacrificed 1, 2, or 7 days later for neurochemical measurements AChE inhibition, muscarinic receptor binding using 3Hquinuclidinyl benzilate QNB and 3Hcis-methyldioxolane CD as ligands, HACU and 3HHC-3 binding in frontal cortex. Despite extensive AChE inhibition 90-93 at all time points, relatively minor degrees of overt toxicity were noted in CPF-treated rats. Binding to the non-selective muscarinic antagonist 3HQNB was reduced 10-34, whereas binding to the putative m2-selective agonist 3HCD was increased 15-23 at all three time points. HACU was reduced 20 in crude synaptosomes prepared from CPF-treated rats 1 day following exposure but no significant changes were noted at 2 or 7 days after treatment. CPF-oxon, the active oxidative metabolite of CPF, was a weak inhibitor of HACU in vitro IC50 gt 200 microM. Binding to 3HHC-3 was reduced in a dose-related manner 1 day after CPF exposure. Kinetic analyses of 3HHC-3 binding 1 day after CPF 280 mg/kg indicated a significant reduction in density Bmax control, 187 /- 18 fmol/mg protein CPF, 104 /- 12 fmol/mg protein with no apparent change in binding affinity Kd control, 25 /- 3 nM CPF, 19 /- 3 nM. These results suggest that a reduction in HACU/acetylcholine synthesis may contribute, along with compensatory changes in cholinergic receptors, to the diminished toxicity following extensive AChE inhibition by CPF."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"The differential inhibition of the target esterases acetylcholinesterase AChE and neuropathy target esterase NTE, neurotoxic esterase by organophosphorus compounds OPs is followed by distinct neurological consequences in exposed subjects. The present study demonstrates that neuroblastoma cell lines human SH-SY5Y and murine NB41A3 can be used to differentiate between neuropathic OPs i.e., those inhibiting NTE and causing organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy and acutely neurotoxic OPs i.e., those highly capable of inhibiting AChE. In these experiments, concentration-response data indicated that the capability to inhibit AChE was over 100x greater than the capability to inhibit NTE for acutely toxic, nonneuropathic OPs e.g., paraoxon and malaoxon in both cell lines. Inhibition of AChE was greater than inhibition of NTE, without overlap of the concentration-response curves, for OPs which are more likely to cause acute, rather than delayed, neurotoxic effects in vivo e.g., chlorpyrifos-oxon, dichlorvos, and trichlorfon. In contrast, concentrations inhibiting AChE and NTE overlapped for neuropathy-causing OPs. For example, apparent IC50 values for NTE inhibition were less than 9.6-fold the apparent IC50 values for AChE inhibition when cells were exposed to the neuropathy-inducing OPs diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate, cyclic tolyl saligenin phosphate, phenyl saligenin phosphate, mipafox, dibutyl dichlorovinyl phosphate, and di-octyl-dichlorovinyl phosphate. In all cases, esterase inhibition occurred at lower concentrations than those needed for cytoxicity. These results suggest that either mouse or human neuroblastoma cell lines can be considered useful in vitro models to distinguish esterase-inhibiting OP neurotoxicants."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"1 In vitro studies with human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase AChE and the mouse diaphragm model were performed to unravel the various microscopic reaction parameters that contribute to the dynamic equilibrium of AChE inhibition, ageing and reactivation. These data may help to define more precisely the indications and limitations of oxime therapy in organophosphate OP poisoning. 2 Diethylphosphoryl-AChE resulting from intoxications with parathion, chlorpyrifos, chlorfenvinphos, diazinon and other OPs is characterized by slow spontaneous reactivation and low propensity for ageing. This kind of phosphorylated enzyme is particularly susceptible to reactivation by oximes. 3 None of the oximes tested pralidoxime, obidoxime, HI 6 and HL 7 can be regarded as a universally suitable reactivator. Obidoxime turned out to be the most potent and most efficacious oxime in reactivating AChE inhibited by various classes of OP insecticides and tabun. Obidoxime, however, was inferior to HI 6 against soman, sarin, cyclosarin and VX. Pralidoxime was generally less potent. 4 The kinetic data of reactivation established for diethylphosphoryl-AChE of human red cells indicate that the usually recommended dosage to attain a plasma concentration of 4 micrograms/ml does not permit exploitation of the full therapeutic potential of the oximes, in particular of pralidoxime. However, in suicidal mega-dose poisoning, oximes, even at optimal plasma concentrations, may be unable to cope with the fast re-inhibition of reactivated AChE in the first days following intoxication. 5 It is suggested that oximes be administered by continuous infusion following an initial bolus dose as long as reactivation can be expected and until permanent clinical improvement is achieved."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Carboxylesterases CbxE can be inhibited by organophosphorus esters OPs without causing clinical evidence of toxicity. CbxE are thought to protect the critical enzyme acetylcholinesterase AChE from OP inhibition in animals. CbxE and AChE are both present in neuroblastoma cells, but, even though these cells have potential to be an in vitro model of OP toxicity, the effect of OPs on CbxE and the relationship of CbxE inhibition and AChE inhibition have not yet been examined in these cells. Therefore, this study examined concentration-related OP-induced inhibition of CbxE in human SH-SY5Y and mouse NB41A3 neuroblastoma cells with 11 active esterase inhibitors paraoxon, malaoxon, chlorpyrifos-oxon, tolyl saligenin phosphate TSP, phenyl saligenin phosphate PSP, diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate DFP, mipafox, dichlorvos, trichlorfon, dibutyryl dichlorovinyl phosphate DBVP, and dioctyl dichlorovinyl phosphate DOVP. All could inhibit CbxE, although the enzyme was less likely to be inhibited than AChE following exposure to 9 of the test compounds in the human cell line and to all 11 of the test compounds in the murine cell line. Species differences in concentration-related inhibitions of CbxE were evident. When cells were exposed first to an OP with a low IC50 toward CbxE PSP, followed by an OP with high affinity for AChE paraoxon or malaoxon, inhibitions of CbxE and AChE were additive. This indicated that CbxE did not protect AChE from OP-induced inhibition in this cell culture model."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Organophosphorus pesticides OPs exert acute toxicity through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE in target tissues. Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated, however, that dosages of the OPs chlorpyrifos CPF or parathion PS, which cause similar degrees of brain AChE inhibition in adult male rats, can produce marked differences in toxicity. While compensatory changes in postsynaptic receptors can modulate the clinical expression of AChE inhibition and lead to tolerance to these toxicants, we propose that OP-selective changes in presynaptic cholinergic processes can also regulate the ultimate consequences of AChE inhibition. The relative effects of either vehicle peanut oil, 2 ml/kg, sc, CPF 280 mg/kg, or PS 6.6 mg/kg on clinical signs of toxicity and AChE activity, high-affinity choline uptake HACU, and potassium-evoked acetylcholine ACh release in striatum were examined for a 7-d period after exposure in adult female Sprague-Dawley rats. In vitro effects of CPF-oxon or paraoxon, the active oxidative metabolites of CPF and PS, on HACU were also examined in comparison with the prototype inhibitor hemicholinium-3 HC-3. Similar to our previous findings in male rats, female rats treated with dosages of CPF or PS causing similar maximal degrees of AChE inhibition 82-96 exhibited marked differences in response that is, PS produced more extensive signs of acute toxicity salivation, lacrimation, urination and/or defecation, i.e., SLUD signs and involuntary movements. CPF reduced striatal synaptosomal HACU at 1, 2, and 7 d after exposure, whereas PS only decreased HACU at 2 d posttreatment. While CPF-oxon was a weak inhibitor of HACU IC50 gt 200 microM, paraoxon had no effect on this process in vitro. Potassium-evoked ACh release in the presence of physostigmine 20 microM was not affected by either OP at 1 d but was increased 2 d after either CPF or PS treatment and remained elevated at 7 d after exposure in CPF-treated rats only. ACh release in the presence of both physostigmine and the muscarinic antagonist atropine 1 microM was decreased by both OPs as early as 1 d after exposure and remained lower at 2 d posttreatment. By 7 d, however, ACh release in response to atropine was decreased in CPF-treated animals only, suggesting that both CPF and PS affected muscarinic autoreceptor function but with somewhat different time courses. These results suggest that different OPs may selectively modify presynaptic cholinergic processes and that early, OP-selective changes in HACU/ACh synthesis may contribute to the differential toxicity noted following extensive AChE inhibition by either CPF or PS."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"An in vitro model, the aggregating brain cell culture of fetal rat telencephalon, has been used to study the maturation-dependent sensitivity of brain cells to two organophosphorus pesticides OPs, chlorpyrifos and parathion, and to their oxon derivatives. Immature DIV 5-15 or differentiated DIV 25-35 brain cells were treated continuously for 10 days. Acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibitory potency for the OPs was compared to that of eserine physostigmine, a reversible AChE inhibitor. Oxon derivatives were more potent AChE inhibitors than the parent compounds, and parathion was more potent than chlorpyrifos. No maturation-dependent differences for AChE inhibition were found for chlorpyrifos and eserine, whereas for parathion and paraoxon there was a tendency to be more effective in immature cultures, while the opposite was true for chlorpyrifos-oxon. Toxic effects, assessed by measuring protein content as an index of general cytotoxicity, and various enzyme activities as cell-type-specific neuronal and glial markers ChAT and GAD, for cholinergic and GABAergic neurons, respectively, and GS and CNP, for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, respectively were only found at more than 70 of AChE inhibition. Immature compared to differentiated cholinergic neurons appeared to be more sensitive to OP treatments. The oxon derivates were found to be more toxic on neurons than the parent compounds, and chlorpyrifos was more toxic than parathion. Eserine was not neurotoxic. These results indicate that inhibition of AChE remains the most sensitive macromolecular target of OP exposure, since toxic effects were found at concentrations in which AChE was inhibited. Furthermore, the compound-specific reactions, the differential pattern of toxicity of OPs compared to eserine, and the higher sensitivity of immature brain cells suggest that the toxic effects and inhibition of AChE are unrelated."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos CPF is an organophosphorus insecticide that elicits toxicity through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE. Young animals are markedly more sensitive than adults to the acute toxicity of CPF. We evaluated acetylcholine ACh release and its muscarinic receptor-mediated regulation i.e. muscarinic autoreceptor function, MAF during maturation as a possible contributing factor to age-related differences in sensitivity. Cortical and striatal slices were prelabeled with 3Hcholine chloride, superfused in the presence or absence of the anticholinesterase physostigmine PHY, 20 microM and stimulated twice S1 and S2 with a high concentration of potassium chloride 20 mM. Depolarization-stimulated ACh release DSAR was lowest in neonatal, intermediate in juvenile and markedly higher in adult tissues. MAF was not detectable in tissues from neonatal rats but was present in juvenile and adult tissues. ACh release and MAF were studied at 4, 24 and 96 h following oral exposure to CPF 0, 0.5 or 1 x LD10. In general, 40-60 and 80-90 maximal AChE inhibition followed exposure to the respective 0.5 and 1 x LD10 dosages. DSAR was decreased in neonatal cortex 1 day after LD10 exposure but increased in juvenile striatum 1 day after LD10 treatment. In adults, DSAR was reduced at 4 and 24 h after exposure, but increased 96 h after CPF exposure. In juveniles, MAF was reduced in both brain regions at 24 h after 0.5LD10 exposure and at 24 and 96 h after LD10 exposure in cortex. A later reduction in MAF was noted in adult tissues i.e. only at 96 h after LD10 treatment. Together, the results suggest that ACh release dynamics in brain vary markedly during postnatal maturation and that acute CPF exposure can alter ACh release in an age-related manner. The functional status of presynaptic processes regulating neurotransmitter release may contribute to age-related neurotoxicity elicited by high-dose exposures to chlorpyrifos."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"In 1998 a panel of experts met to discuss the data available on chlorpyrifos, both human and animal, and to determine the most appropriate endpoints to be used for the derivation of the reference dose RfD. Since that time, additional data have become available on chlorpyrifos from an experimental study involving humans. Moreover, Food Quality Protection Act FQPA considerations need to be addressed, and the appropriate cholinesterase endpoint, whether plasma, red blood cell, peripheral nerve, or brain, has become highly debated. Therefore, Dow AgroSciences, one of the manufacturers of chlorpyrifos, convened a second panel of toxicology and medical experts on June 21, 1999, to consider the presently available scientific literature both published and unpublished on chlorpyrifos and to determine the acute and chronic toxicological RfDs for chlorpyrifos. Four questions were posed to this second panel of experts concerning the available data on chlorpyrifos. 1 Should the RfD for chlorpyrifos be based on acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition or butyrylcholinesterase BuChE inhibition as an endpoint for adverse effect? 2 Should the RfDs for chlorpyrifos be based on the data set from three human studies, which are supported by animal data? 3 Should the FQPA safety factor be reduced to 1xbased on animal studies of pre- or postnatal toxicity? 4 If an RfD for chlorpyrifos were to be based on animal data, then is a 10-fold interspecies uncertainty factor necessary? The panel of experts concluded that 1 inhibition of BuChE is not an adverse effect, and the RfD for chlorpyrifos should be based on AChE inhibition 2 the RfD for chlorpyrifos should be based on the three available human studies, which are also supported by animal data 3 the extra FQPA safety factor should be reduced to 1x, because chlorpyrifos shows no pre- or postnatal toxicity of concern at relevant human exposure conditions and 4 the extra 10-fold safety factor for interspecies variation appears overly conservative because no differences in species sensitivity to chlorpyrifos is evident."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro modulation of muscarinic autoreceptor function by the organophosphorus OP anticholinesterases chlorpyrifos oxon, paraoxon, and methyl paraoxon. Acetylcholine ACh release was studied by preloading slices from rat striatum with 3Hcholine and depolarizing with potassium 20 mM in perfusion buffer containing hemicholinium-3 to prevent reuptake of radiolabeled choline. Under these conditions, chlorpyrifos oxon, paraoxon, and methyl paraoxon 0.1-10 microM all reduced ACh release in a concentration-dependent manner. Addition of the carbamate acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibitor physostigmine 20 microM to the perfusion buffer also decreased ACh release. When physostigmine was present, the three oxons had no additional effect on ACh release. Concentration-dependent inhibition of AChE activity in striatal slices perfused with chlorpyrifos oxon 0.1, 1, and 10 microM suggested AChE inhibition was responsible for oxon-mediated alterations in ACh release. To differentiate between direct and indirect actions of the OP toxicants on muscarinic autoreceptors, we compared the effects of the oxons on ACh release under two conditions, i.e., tissues were perfused with buffer containing only hemicholinium-3 or with buffer containing hemicholinium-3, physostigmine, and the nonselective muscarinic receptor blocker atropine 100 nM. In the presence of only hemicholinium-3, concentration-dependent inhibition of ACh release was again noted for all oxons, similar to the effects of the muscarinic agonists carbachol and cis-dioxolane. In the presence of physostigmine and atropine, the relative potencies of all agents were markedly reduced. Interestingly, carbachol, cis-dioxolane, paraoxon, and methyl paraoxon all decreased ACh release as before, but chlorpyrifos oxon 100-300 microM actually increased ACh release. Together, the results suggest that chlorpyrifos oxon, paraoxon, and methyl paraoxon can activate muscarinic autoreceptors indirectly through inhibition of AChE. Both paraoxon and methyl paraoxon also directly activate whereas chlorpyrifos oxon blocks muscarinic autoreceptor function. Qualitative differences in the direct actions of these oxons at this presynaptic regulatory site could contribute to differential toxicity with high-dose exposures."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"A PBPK/PD model was developed for the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos CPF O,O-diethyl-O-3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl-phosphorothioate, and the major metabolites CPF-oxon and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol TCP in rats and humans. This model integrates target tissue dosimetry and dynamic response i.e., esterase inhibition describing uptake, metabolism, and disposition of CPF, CPF-oxon, and TCP and the associated cholinesterase ChE inhibition kinetics in blood and tissues following acute and chronic oral and dermal exposure. To facilitate model development, single oral-dose pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in rats 0.5-100 mg/kg and humans 0.5-2 mg/kg, and the kinetics of CPF, CPF-oxon, and TCP were determined, as well as the extent of blood plasma/RBC and brain rats only ChE inhibition. In blood, the concentration of analytes followed the order TCP gtgt CPF gtgt CPF-oxon in humans CPF-oxon was not quantifiable. Simulations were compared against experimental data and previously published studies in rats and humans. The model was utilized to quantitatively compare dosimetry and dynamic response between rats and humans over a range of CPF doses. The time course of CPF and TCP in both species was linear over the dose range evaluated, and the model reasonably simulated the dose-dependent inhibition of plasma ChE, RBC acetylcholinesterase AChE, and brain rat only AChE. Model simulations suggest that rats exhibit greater metabolism of CPF to CPF-oxon than humans do, and that the depletion of nontarget B-esterase is associated with a nonlinear, dose-dependent increase in CPF-oxon blood and brain concentration. This CPF PBPK/PD model quantitatively estimates target tissue dosimetry and AChE inhibition and is a strong framework for further organophosphate OP model development and for refining a biologically based risk assessment for exposure to CPF under a variety of scenarios."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"The organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos and the carbamate insecticide carbaryl were investigated in adult male rats in terms of their effects on the activity of brain monoamine oxidase-A MAO-A activity and on the platelet uptake of 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT. The activities of brain acetylcholinesterase AChE and plasma butyrylcholinesterase BuChE were also determined. For each compound two different dosage regimens were employed. In the acute study, chlorpyrifos or carbaryl was administered at a single intraperitoneal dose of 100 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg, respectively In the subacute study, chlorpyrifos was injected at a daily dose of 20 mg/kg for 7 days, while carbaryl was given at a daily dose of 10 mg/kg for 14 days. Acute chlorpyrifos administration produced a 85.01 inhibition of AChE and a 43.4 inhibition of BuChE but had no effect on MAO-A activity and 5-HT uptake. In contrast, subacute chlorpyrifos exposure caused a 94.96 inhibition of AChE and a 85.8 inhibition of BuChE and, also, elicited a significant 35.02 reduction in the platelet uptake of 5-HT. MAO-A activity was not affected. Acute carbaryl administration produced a 56.38 AChE inhibition and a 55.95 BuChE inhibition and also caused a significant 26.36 decrease in 5-HT uptake but no change in MAO-A. Subacute carbaryl exposure failed to affect significantly any of the biochemical parameters determined. Interference with the 5-HT system by chlorpyrifos and carbaryl could contribute to the toxicity of these pesticides."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Previous studies suggest that low doses of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos CPF disrupt brain development and cognitive function by mechanisms that do not involve the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that CPF and its metabolites alter the Ca2/cAMP response element binding protein CREB, a critical molecule in brain development and cognitive function. We further tested the hypothesis that changes in CREB occur independent of AChE inhibition. Western blot analysis of lysates from primary cultures of cortical neurons exposed to CPF, CPF-oxon, or trichloropyridinol TCP for 1 h and cultures exposed to trichloropyridinol TCP for 7 days indicated that all exposures increased the level of the phosphorylated activated form of CREB pCREB, without significant changes in total CREB or alpha-tubulin. Remarkably, pCREB in cortical neurons was elevated by 300-400 of control levels with estimated EC50s of 60 pM, lt30 fM, and lt30 pM for CPF, CPF-oxon, and TCP, respectively. AChE activity and cell viability were not affected by organophosphate concentrations that caused significant increases in pCREB up to 100 nM, 100 pM, and 10 microM of CPF, CPF-oxon, and TCP, respectively. The level of pCREB in hippocampal neurons was also elevated after exposure to CPF, but pCREB in cultured astrocytes was not affected. Inclusion of the cytochrome P-450 inhibitor SKF-525A did not inhibit the effects of CPF on pCREB levels, indicating that metabolism of CPF to CPF-oxon was not necessary to cause the increase in pCREB. The increases in neuronal pCREB observed in this study provide biochemical evidence that CPF and its metabolites are active at critical sites within the nervous system at levels far below those required to inhibit AChE, which could explain many of the reported neurodevelopmental and behavioral changes attributed to CPF toxicity."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Steelhead trout Oncorhynchus mykiss were exposed for 96 h to the organophosphate chlorpyrifos to establish benchmark concentration BMC values in the low-effect range of brain acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency U.S. EPA benchmark dose software was used to model the data. Benchmark concentrations were determined for a range of inhibition levels at 5, 10, and 20, at 1 and 2 control standard deviations SD, and at an experimental limit-of-detection level of 2.5. One contributing difficulty in establishing precise inhibition BMCs in the lower effect region is the variability associated with the AChE analytical method. To minimize this variability, the Ellman method was modified specifically for analysis of O. mykiss brain tissue. Laboratory-established BMCs for chlorpyrifos were then compared with the U.S. EPA 96-h water quality criteria and with the concentration levels detected in Northwest surface waters that are home to threatened steelhead trout. The U.S. EPA 96-h water quality criteria of 0.083 microg/L is below the BMC02.5, the limit-of-detection value for this study. The average chlorpyrifos concentration detected during a two-week period in one monitored stream was 0.127 microg/L, which approaches the BMC02.5. The peak chlorpyrifos concentration detected at 0.482 microg/L is near the BMC1SD estimate."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Acetylcholine ACh release is modulated pre-synaptically by both muscarinic and nicotinic receptor-mediated processes. While muscarinic autoreceptors inhibit ACh release, nicotinic autoreceptors enhance ACh release and thus disruption of these processes could potentially affect cholinergic toxicity following exposure to anticholinesterases. Marked age-related differences in sensitivity to some organophosphorus OP anticholinesterases have been reported. We compared nicotinic autoreceptor function NAF during maturation and aging and evaluated its potential modulation by the common OP insecticide, chlorpyrifos CPF. Cortical synaptosomes were pre-loaded with 3Hcholine, superfused 0.6 ml/min with physiological buffer and 3HACh release was evoked with potassium KCl, 9 mM, with or without co-addition of exogenous ACh to stimulate nicotinic autoreceptors. Fractions of perfusate were subsequently collected and area under the curve AUC for 3H was analyzed by scintillation counting. The difference in evoked release due to co-addition of exogenous ACh was defined as NAF. Under these conditions, atropine ATR, 0.1 microM appeared requisite for NAF thus this muscarinic antagonist was subsequently added to all perfusion buffers. In synaptosomes from adult tissues, exogenous ACh 3-100 microM significantly increased release in a concentration-dependent manner. The nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine MEC, 100 microM substantially reduced the potassium-evoked release elicited by co-addition of ACh 10 microM. Interestingly, the nicotinic agonists nicotine NIC and dimethylphenylpiperazinium DMPP 0.1-10 microM had no effect on release. The active metabolite of CPF i.e. chlorpyrifos oxon CPO, 1-10 microM inhibited NAF in vitro. Maturation-related expression of NAF was noted AUC with co-addition of 10 microM ACh 7-day rats, 7/-6 21-day rats, 44/-6 90-day rats, 196/-37 24-month rats, 173/-52. NAF was substantially reduced 67-91 96 h after maximum tolerated dosages of CPF in adult and aged rats 279 mg/kg, sc but not in juveniles 127 mg/kg, sc, even though AChE inhibition was similar among the age groups gt80. Together these data suggest that NAF is differentially expressed during maturation and that this neuromodulatory process may be selectively altered by some OP insecticides, potentially contributing to age-related differences in response to AChE inhibitors. As NAF has been postulated to be activated under conditions of impaired cholinergic function, selective alteration of this pre-synaptic process by OP anticholinesterases may be also important in age-related conditions associated with cholinergic hypofunction."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos, an acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibitor, is a widely used organophosphate pesticide. Recent concern has focused on its neurotoxicity that is not attributable to AChE inhibition. Here, we report that chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-oxon, but not 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol TCP the breakdown product of chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-oxon, induce apoptosis in primary cortical neurons cultured from embryonic day 17 or newborn rats. It is generally agreed that chlorpyrifos-oxon is approximately three orders of magnitude more potent than chlorpyrifos in inhibition of brain acetylcholinesterase activity. However, our data demonstrate that chlorpyrifos-oxon is only slightly more potent than chlorpyrifos in inducing apoptosis. This indicates that chlorpyrifos-induced apoptosis may occur independently of AChE inhibition, although AChE activity was not measured in this study. Furthermore, chlorpyrifos activates the ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinases. Surprisingly, blocking ERK1/2 activation by the MEK inhibitor SL327 caused a small but statistically significant inhibition of apoptosis, while blocking p38 with SB202190 significantly accelerated apoptosis induced by chlorpyrifos. This suggests a pro- and anti-apoptotic role for ERK1/2 and p38, respectively. Although chlorpyrifos did not stimulate total JNK activity, it caused a sustained activation of a sub-pool of JNK in the nucleus and stimulated phosphorylation of c-Jun, a downstream target of JNK. Transient expression of a dominant negative c-Jun mutant inhibited chlorpyrifos-induced apoptosis, suggesting a role for JNK and JNK-mediated transcription in this cell death. Together, our data suggest apoptosis as a novel toxic endpoint of chlorpyrifos neurotoxicity in the brain that may be independent of AChE inhibition. Furthermore, activation of the ERK1/2 and JNK MAP kinases contributes to, while activation of the p38 MAP kinase counteracts chlorpyrifos-induced apoptosis in cortical neurons."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"It has been suggested that pesticide exposure may be a contributing factor underlying the increased incidence of asthma in the United States and other industrialized nations. To test this hypothesis, airway hyperreactivity was measured in guinea pigs exposed to chlorpyrifos, a widely used organophosphate pesticide. Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves caused frequency-dependent bronchoconstriction that was significantly potentiated in animals 24 h or 7 days after a single subcutaneous injection of either 390 mg/kg or 70 mg/kg of chlorpyrifos, respectively. Mechanisms by which chlorpyrifos may cause airway hyperreactivity include inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE or dysfunction of M3 muscarinic receptors on airway smooth muscle or of autoinhibitory M2 muscarinic receptors on parasympathetic nerves in the lung. AChE activity in the lung was significantly inhibited 24 h after treatment with 390 mg/kg of chlorpyrifos, but not 7 days after injection of 70 mg/kg of chlorpyrifos. Acute exposure to eserine 250 microg/ml also significantly inhibited lung AChE but did not potentiate vagally induced bronchoconstriction. Neuronal M2 receptor function was tested using the M2 agonist pilocarpine, which inhibits vagally induced bronchoconstriction in control animals. In chlorpyrifos-treated animals, pilocarpine dose-response curves were shifted significantly to the right, demonstrating decreased responsiveness of neuronal M2 receptors. In contrast, chlorpyrifos treatment did not alter methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction, suggesting that chlorpyrifos does not alter M3 muscarinic receptor function on airway smooth muscle. These data demonstrate that organophosphate insecticides can cause airway hyperreactivity in the absence of AChE inhibition by decreasing neuronal M2 receptor function."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"The primary mechanism of action for organophosphorus OP insecticides, like chlorpyrifos and parathion, is to inhibit acetylcholinesterase AChE by their oxygenated metabolites oxons, due to the phosphorylation of the serine hydroxyl group located in the active site of the molecule. The rate of phosphorylation is described by the bimolecular inhibitory rate constant ki, which has been used for quantification of OP inhibitory capacity. It has been proposed that a peripheral binding site exists on the AChE molecule, which, when occupied, reduces the capacity of additional oxon molecules to phosphorylate the active site. The aim of this study was to evaluate the interaction of chlorpyrifos oxon CPO and paraoxon PO with rat brain AChE to assess the dynamics of AChE inhibition and the potential role of a peripheral binding site. The ki values for AChE inhibition determined at oxon concentrations of 1-100 nM were 0.206 /- 0.018 and 0.0216 nM-1h-1 for CPO and PO, respectively. The spontaneous reactivation rates of the inhibited AChE for CPO and PO were 0.084-0.087 two determinations and 0.091 /- 0.023 h-1, respectively. In contrast, the ki values estimated at a low oxon concentration 1 pM were approximately 1,000- and 10,000-fold higher than those determined at high CPO and PO concentrations, respectively. At low concentrations, the ki estimates were approximately similar for both CPO and PO 150-180 two determinations and 300 /- 180 nM-1h-1, respectively. This implies that, at low concentrations, both oxons exhibited similar inhibitory potency in contrast to the marked difference exhibited at higher concentrations. These results support the potential importance of a secondary peripheral binding site associated with AChE kinetics, particularly at low, environmentally relevant concentrations."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Acetylcholinesterase AChE activity was measured in Daphnia magna that had been exposed to four organophosphates OPs parathion, chlorpyrifos, malathion, and acephate and one carbamate propoxur for 48 h. These results were related to acute toxicity median effective concentration EC50 for immobility. For the four OPs, the EC50s were 7.03 pM, 3.17 pM, 10.56 pM, and 309.82 microM, respectively. The EC50 for propoxur was 449.90 pM. Reduction in AChE activity was directly related to an increase in immobility in all chemicals tested. However, the ratio between the EC50 and the AChE median inhibiting concentration ranged from 0.31 to 0.90. A 50 reduction in AChE activity generally was associated with detrimental effects on mobility. However, for acephate, high levels of AChE inhibition 70 were observed in very low concentrations and were not associated with immobility. In addition, increasing the concentration of acephate further had a slight negative effect on AChE activity but a strong detrimental effect on mobility. Binding sites other than AChE possibly are involved in acephate toxicity to D. magna. Our findings demonstrate different associations between AChE inhibition and toxicity when different chemicals are compared. Therefore, the value of using AChE activity as a biomarker in D. magna will be dependent on the chemical tested."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Chronic and acute exposure to organophosphate OP pesticides may lead to persistent neurological and neurobehavioral effects, which cannot be explained by acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition alone. It is suggested that other brain proteins are involved. Effects of commonly used organophosphate pesticides on rat neuronal alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors nAChRs expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes have been investigated using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Several OP pesticides, e.g., parathion-ethyl, chlorpyrifos and disulfoton, inhibited the ACh-induced ion current with potencies in the micromolar range. The potency of inhibition increased with increasing concentrations of the agonist ACh. Comparison of the potency of nAChR inhibition with the potency of AChE inhibition demonstrated that some OPs inhibit nAChRs more potently than AChE. Binding experiments on alpha4beta2 nAChRs showed that the OPs noncompetitively interact with nAChRs. The inhibitory effects on nAChRs are adequately described and explained by a sequential two-step mechanism, in which rapidly reversible OP binding to a separate binding site leads to inhibition followed by a stabilization of the blocked state or receptor desensitization. It is concluded that OPs interact directly with neuronal alpha4beta2 nAChRs to inhibit the agonist-induced response. This implicates that neuronal alpha4beta2 nAChRs are additional targets for some OP pesticides."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"We previously demonstrated that the organophosphorus OP insecticide chlorpyrifos potentiates vagally induced bronchoconstriction independent of acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition by decreasing the function of neuronal M2 muscarinic receptors that normally inhibit acetylcholine release from parasympathetic nerves supplying airway smooth muscle. However, it has been reported that different OPs may not affect muscarinic receptors equally. To determine if the effects of chlorpyrifos on airway hyperreactivity can be generalized to other OPs, we tested whether parathion and diazinon also inhibit neuronal M2 receptor function resulting in airway hyperreactivity. In control animals, the M2 agonist pilocarpine inhibits vagally induced bronchoconstriction in a dose-related manner. Treatment of guinea pigs with either parathion 1-10 mg/kg, sc or diazinon 0.75-75 mg/kg, sc shifted pilocarpine dose-response curves significantly to the right, indicating loss of neuronal M2 receptor function. These OP treatments also significantly potentiated vagally induced bronchoconstriction. Treatments that did not decrease M2 receptor function parathion at 0.1 mg/kg, sc, or the non-OP insecticide permethrin at 150 mg/kg, sc also did not cause airway hyperreactivity. None of the OP treatments altered bronchoconstriction induced by iv acetylcholine or methacholine in vagotomized guinea pigs, suggesting that OP-induced airway hyperreactivity is not due to altered function of muscarinic receptors on airway smooth muscle or to AChE inhibition. AChE assays of lung, blood, and brain confirmed that parathion and diazinon decreased M2 function at concentrations that did not inhibit AChE. These data suggest that multiple diethyl phosphorothionate OPs cause airway hyperreactivity via a common mechanism of M2 receptor dysfunction independent of AChE inhibition."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos is a common organophosphate insecticide that has been widely detected in surface waters that provide habitat for Pacific salmon in the western United States. Although chlorpyrifos is known to inhibit acetylcholinesterase AChE in the brain and muscle of salmonids, the relationship between sublethal AChE inhibition and more integrative indicators of neuro-behavioral impairment are poorly understood. This is particularly true for exposures that reflect the typical range of pesticide concentrations in the aquatic environment. To directly compare the effects of chlorpyrifos on AChE activity and salmon behavior, we exposed juvenile coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch to chlorpyrifos 0-2.5 microg/L for 96 h. A computer-assisted, three-dimensional video imaging system was used to measure spontaneous swimming and feeding behaviors in control and chlorpyrifos-exposed fish. After the behavioral trials, brain and muscle tissues were collected and analyzed for AChE activity. Chlorpyrifos inhibited tissue AChE activity and all behaviors in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, brain AChE inhibition and reductions in spontaneous swimming and feeding activity were significantly correlated. Benchmark concentrations for sublethal neurotoxicity statistical departure values were lt0.5 microg/L and were similar for both neurochemical and behavioral endpoints. Collectively, these results indicate a close relationship between brain AChE inhibition and behavioral impairment in juvenile coho exposed to chlorpyrifos at environmentally realistic concentrations."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"The acute toxicity of chlorpyrifos and monocrotophos to subterranean termites, Odontotermes obesus Rambur, has been studied by a paper contact method. The LC50 values for chlorpyrifos and monocrotophos were 0.046 and 0.148 microg cm-2, respectively. Chlorpyrifos was 3.22-fold more toxic than monocrotophos. The effect of the pesticides on locomotor behaviour velocity and head acetylcholinesterase AChE EC 3.1.1.7 activity was estimated in LC50-exposed termites at intervals of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 h. Chlorpyrifos- and monocrotophos-treated termites showed, respectively, 97 and 88 reduction in locomotor behaviour velocity after 24 h. At all time intervals the chlorpyrifos-treated termites exhibited more AChE inhibition and showed greater distorted behaviour than those exposed to monocrotophos. In vitro studies indicated that the I50 value 50 inhibition for chlorpyrifos against AChE was 8.75 times that of monocrotophos."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"The effect of organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos CPF on acetylcholinesterase AChE activity and on skeletal muscle development in Xenopus laevis larvae was studied. To achieve our purpose embryos were exposed to 100, 250 and 3000 microg/l CPF concentrations from late blastula stage 8 h postfertilization, p.f. to stage 47 120 h p.f. and the appearance of AChE activity was monitored every 24 h. Compared with control, CPF treated larvae showed a dose dependent AChE inhibition during the early stages beginning from 24 h until 120 h p.f. that are crucial for neuromuscular development. The amount of AChE activity that can still be measured in treated larvae at stage 47 relative to that of the control, ranged from 28 in CPFs 100 microg/l to 4 in CPFs 3000 microg/l. These low AChE activities were associated with muscular damages such as reduced myotome size and hypertrophies coupled with extensive vacuolated regions in myocytes. The occurrence of this tissue-specific injury was related to CPF concentrations and was most pronounced in CPFs 3000 microg/l which revealed a very severe AChE inhibition during the exposure. Since AChE is the major neurotransmitter of the neuromuscular system, this initial descriptive study will be an useful starting-point to ongoing and future subcellular/molecular studies that correlate the morphological damage with changes in AChE activity."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Egasyn-beta-glucuronidase complex is located at the luminal site of liver microsomal endoplasmic reticulum. When organophosphorus insecticides OP are incorporated into the liver microsomes, they become tightly bound to egasyn, a carboxylesterase isozyme, and subsequently, beta-glucuronidase BG is dissociated and released into blood. Consequently, the increase in plasma BG activity becomes a good biomarker of OP exposure. Thus, the single administration of EPN O-ethyl O-p-nitrophenylphenylphosphonothioate, acephate and chlorpyrifos increased plasma BG activity in approximately 100-fold the control level in rats. The increase in plasma BG activity after OP exposure is a much more sensitive biomarker of acute OP exposure than acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Acetylcholinesterase AChE is one of several hundred serine hydrolases in people potentially exposed to about 80 organophosphorus OP compounds important as insecticides or chemical warfare agents. The toxicology of OPs was interpreted until recently almost solely on the basis of AChE inhibition. It is assumed that each serine hydrolase has a specific function and proposed that every OP compound has a unique inhibitory profile. This review considers the progress in sifting the expanding list of potential serine hydrolase toxicological targets. About 50 serine hydrolase targets have been recognized but only a few studied thoroughly. The toxicological relevance of known secondary OP targets is established mainly from observations with humans butyrylcholinesterase and neuropathy target esterase-lysophospholipase and studies with mice cannabinoid CB1 receptor, carboxylesterase, lysophospholipase and platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase and hen eggs arylformamidase or kynurenine formamidase. Pesticides most commonly shown to inhibit these targets in experimental vertebrates are chlorpyrifos and tribufos. Generally the levels of environmental and occupational OP pesticide exposure are well below those causing in vivo inhibition of secondary serine hydrolase targets. Although exposure to OP insecticides is decreasing from stricter regulations and the development of resistant pest strains, it will continue to some degree for decades in the future. Only two OPs are used as pharmaceuticals, i.e. echothiophate as an ophthalmic for treatment of glaucoma and metrifonate as an anthelmintic for Schistosoma and formerly as a candidate drug for improved cognitive function in Alzheimers disease. In safety evaluations, knowledge on known OP targets must be balanced against major gaps in current understanding since more than 75 of the serine hydrolases are essentially unknown as to OP targeting and relevance, i.e. it is not clear if they play a role in OP toxicology."
Chlorpyrifos,AChE inhibition,"Three life stages of larval grass shrimp were tested to determine whether acetylcholinesterase AChE activity expressed as 24-h sublethal effect endpoints EC20 and EC50 could be used to predict 96-h mortality lowest observable effect concentration LOEC and LC50 for shrimp exposed to three organophosphate insecticides. With regard to mortality, newly hatched larvae and 18-day-old larvae were the most sensitive in the malathion and azinphosmethyl exposures. In the chlorpyrifos exposures, newly hatched larvae and postlarvae were the most sensitive life stages. Results of the 24-h AChE inhibition tests showed that newly hatched larvae were generally more sensitive in the three organophosphate exposures. A regression analysis of the EC50s and LC50s yielded the strongest correlation with R2=0.987 correlation coefficient=0.994 and 95 confidence intervals 0.969-0.999. The LOEC/EC20 relationship yielded R2=0.962. For these grass shrimp life stages and pesticides, sublethal effect endpoints could be used as a predictor of 96-h mortality."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos 0,0-diethyl 0-3,5,6-trichloro-pyridyl phosphorothioate caused delayed polyneuropathy in man. Contrary to previous studies, we report here that it also causes delayed polyneuropathy in the hen, the animal model for this toxicity. The minimal neuropathic dose was 60-90 mg/kg p.o., corresponding to 4-6 times the estimated LD50. Consequently, pralidoxime 2-PAM in conjunction with atropine was necessary to reverse acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition and cholinergic toxicity in hens given high enough doses of chlorpyrifos to cause neuropathy. Chlorpyrifos was slowly absorbed after single oral doses and the threshold of inhibition greater than 70 of neuropathy target esterase NTE, the putative target for delayed neuropathy, was reached within 5-6 days. High AChE inhibition greater than 90, however, was measured within hours after dosing because of the higher potency of chlorpyrifos to inhibit this enzyme. In vitro studies showed that chlorpyrifos-oxon, the active metabolite of chlorpyrifos, was 10-20 times more active against AChE than against NTE, confirming the clinical observation. No differences were seen between human and hen enzymes in this respect. Hen and human brain homogenates contain A-esterases which hydrolysed chlorpyrifos to about the same extent in both species. In conclusion, chlorpyrifos causes delayed polyneuropathy in the hen, as was reported in man. The reasons for previous negative data in the hen are probably due to the relatively lower doses which were used. Judging from in vitro studies with hen and human enzymes, there are no differences in the two species as far as their relative sensitivity to delayed polyneuropathy. It is likely that delayed polyneuropathy would develop in both species only after severe cholinergic toxicity requiring aggressive antidotal treatment."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"Although the acute effects of organophosphorus esters are generally ascribed to inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, work in this laboratory and others indicates that organophosphorus insecticides also interact directly with cholinergic receptors. The current study verifies that the insecticide O,O-diethyl O-3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinyl phosphorothionate chlorpyrifos and its oxon metabolite inhibits acetylcholinesterase AChE. The metabolite inhibits rat brain AChE three orders of magnitude more rapidly than chlorpyrifos. In addition to their ability to inhibit AChE, these compounds were shown to interact directly with muscarinic receptors of rat striatum. The oxon metabolite bound at low concentrations to muscarinic receptors labeled by the muscarinic agonist 3H cis-methyldioxolane chlorpyrifos oxon bound with an IC50 value of 22.1 /- 3.6 nM. The receptors bound by chlorpyrifos oxon account for approximately 30 of muscarinic receptors of the striatum and are of the m2 subtype. The binding of chlorpyrifos oxon to the m2 receptor results in a covalent modification of the receptor that does not interfere with the ability of the receptor to interact with the agonist carbachol. This receptor modification may be responsible for the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity by chlorpyrifos oxon. The oxon inhibited adenylate cyclase with an IC50 of 155 /- 78 nM. The inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity was not blocked by atropine and was additive to that produced by carbachol. The altering of postreceptor signal transduction by chlorpyrifos oxon may interfere with normal cellular signaling, thereby disturbing neurological function. Direct interaction of chlorpyrifos oxon with muscarinic receptors and associated signal transduction is a potential mechanism of neurotoxicity that is independent of AChE inhibition."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos diethyl 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl phosphorothionate is a broad-spectrum organophosphorus OP insecticide. Anticipated increases in the already extensive use of this compound have prompted this reassessment of its neurotoxicity. Because chlorpyrifos and other OP insecticides are designed to produce acute cholinergic effects through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE and some OP compounds can cause OP compound-induced delayed neurotoxicity OPIDN via chemical modification of neurotoxic esterase neuropathy target esterase, NTE, this review focuses on the capacity of chlorpyrifos to precipitate these and other adverse neurological consequences. Chlorpyrifos exhibits only moderate acute toxicity in many mammalian species, due largely to detoxification of the active metabolite, chlorpyrifos oxon, by A-esterases. Rats given large doses of chlorpyrifos sc in oil have prolonged inhibition of brain AChE, possibly due to slow release of the parent compound from a depot. Associated cognitive and motor deficits return to normal well before recovery of AChE activity and muscarinic receptor down-regulation, as expected from classic tolerance. Controlled studies of OP compound exposures in humans also indicate that cognitive dysfunction requires substantial AChE inhibition. Information is relatively sparse on neurological dysfunction that is secondary to theoretical reproductive, developmental, or immunological effects, but the best available data indicate that such effects are unlikely to result from exposures to chlorpyrifos. In accord with the much greater inhibitory potency of chlorpyrifos oxon for AChE than for NTE, clinical reports and experimental studies indicate that OPIDN from acute exposures to chlorpyrifos requires doses well in excess of the LD50, even when followed by repeated doses of the OPIDN potentiator phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride PMSF. Likewise, studies in hens show that subchronic exposures at the maximum tolerated daily dose do not result in OPIDN. Although exposure to chlorpyrifos as a result of normal use is unlikely to produce classical OPIDN, a recent report stated that mild reversible sensory neuropathy had occurred in eight patients who had been exposed subchronically to unknown amounts of chlorpyrifos. It is not clear whether these cases represent an incorrect linkage of cause and effect, a newly disclosed reversible sensory component of OPIDN, or an entirely new phenomenon. The question of the potential for chlorpyrifos to cause this mild sensory neuropathy could be resolved by the use of quantitative tests of sensory function in animal experiments and/or prospective studies of humans with known exposures to chlorpyrifos."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos CPF, an organophosphorus OP insecticide, exerts toxicity through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE. In the present study, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were given CPF 200 mg/kg, sc as a single dose on gestation d 12 GD12 and then sacrificed on either GD16, GD20, or postnatal d 3 PND3 for measurement of maternal and developmental indicators of toxicity. While most CPF-treated rats exhibited no overt signs, a subset 4/28 showed moderate to severe signs of ""cholinergic"" toxicity at 2-3 d after treatment, and these rats were omitted from further studies. Extensive AChE inhibition 82-88 was noted in maternal brain at all three time points following acute exposures. At GD16 and GD20, fetal brain AChE activity was inhibited 42-44. While some degree of recovery in AChE activity was noted in pup brain by PND3, AChE activity was still inhibited 30 in treated pups cross-fostered to control dams. In vitro inhibition of maternal and fetal GD20 brain AChE activity by the active metabolite, chlorpyrifos oxon, suggested that the prenatal brain AChE activity was somewhat more sensitive IC50 at 37.0 degrees C, 20 min dam, 26.6 /- 1.8 x 10-9 M fetus, 6.7 /- 0.4 x 10-9 M. Maternal brain muscarinic receptor binding was more extensively reduced 30-32 at GD20 and PND3 as compared to the developing brain at GD20 16 and PND3 11. A simple postnatal reflex test righting reflex was transiently altered by CPF. The results suggest that CPF exposure to dams during gestation produces more extensive neurotoxicological effects in the dam relative to the developing fetus."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"Paraoxonase can hydrolyze paraoxon PO, chlorpyrifos-oxon CPO and other organophosphates. Previous studies have indicated that the levels of serum paraoxonase can influence the toxicity of PO and CPO. In the present study we have investigated whether exogenous paraoxonase administered to mice would offer protection toward the acute toxicity of a phosphorothioate, chlorpyrifos CPS. Paraoxonase was purified from rabbit serum and injected i.v., or i.v. plus i.p., in mice. Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE in brain, diaphragm, plasma and red blood cells was measured as an index of CPS 100 mg/kg toxicity. Administration of paraoxonase 30 min before CPS increased plasma enzyme activity toward CPO by 35-fold, and protected against its toxicity protection was still present at 24 h, when enzyme activity was still 20-fold over basal. When paraoxonase was given 30 min after CPS, a significant protection against CPS toxicity was still observed, while after 3 h the protective effect was decreased. To mimic conditions of severe acute poisoning, a higher dose of CPS 150 mg/kg was also administered. Administration of paraoxonase 30 min after this exposure abolished cholinergic signs and significantly protected against AChE inhibition. These results indicate that exogenous paraoxonase offers significant protection against CPS toxicity when administered both before and after the organophosphate, suggesting that it may be considered as a potential additional treatment of organophosphate poisoning."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"The differential inhibition of the target esterases acetylcholinesterase AChE and neuropathy target esterase NTE, neurotoxic esterase by organophosphorus compounds OPs is followed by distinct neurological consequences in exposed subjects. The present study demonstrates that neuroblastoma cell lines human SH-SY5Y and murine NB41A3 can be used to differentiate between neuropathic OPs i.e., those inhibiting NTE and causing organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy and acutely neurotoxic OPs i.e., those highly capable of inhibiting AChE. In these experiments, concentration-response data indicated that the capability to inhibit AChE was over 100x greater than the capability to inhibit NTE for acutely toxic, nonneuropathic OPs e.g., paraoxon and malaoxon in both cell lines. Inhibition of AChE was greater than inhibition of NTE, without overlap of the concentration-response curves, for OPs which are more likely to cause acute, rather than delayed, neurotoxic effects in vivo e.g., chlorpyrifos-oxon, dichlorvos, and trichlorfon. In contrast, concentrations inhibiting AChE and NTE overlapped for neuropathy-causing OPs. For example, apparent IC50 values for NTE inhibition were less than 9.6-fold the apparent IC50 values for AChE inhibition when cells were exposed to the neuropathy-inducing OPs diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate, cyclic tolyl saligenin phosphate, phenyl saligenin phosphate, mipafox, dibutyl dichlorovinyl phosphate, and di-octyl-dichlorovinyl phosphate. In all cases, esterase inhibition occurred at lower concentrations than those needed for cytoxicity. These results suggest that either mouse or human neuroblastoma cell lines can be considered useful in vitro models to distinguish esterase-inhibiting OP neurotoxicants."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"Carboxylesterases CbxE can be inhibited by organophosphorus esters OPs without causing clinical evidence of toxicity. CbxE are thought to protect the critical enzyme acetylcholinesterase AChE from OP inhibition in animals. CbxE and AChE are both present in neuroblastoma cells, but, even though these cells have potential to be an in vitro model of OP toxicity, the effect of OPs on CbxE and the relationship of CbxE inhibition and AChE inhibition have not yet been examined in these cells. Therefore, this study examined concentration-related OP-induced inhibition of CbxE in human SH-SY5Y and mouse NB41A3 neuroblastoma cells with 11 active esterase inhibitors paraoxon, malaoxon, chlorpyrifos-oxon, tolyl saligenin phosphate TSP, phenyl saligenin phosphate PSP, diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate DFP, mipafox, dichlorvos, trichlorfon, dibutyryl dichlorovinyl phosphate DBVP, and dioctyl dichlorovinyl phosphate DOVP. All could inhibit CbxE, although the enzyme was less likely to be inhibited than AChE following exposure to 9 of the test compounds in the human cell line and to all 11 of the test compounds in the murine cell line. Species differences in concentration-related inhibitions of CbxE were evident. When cells were exposed first to an OP with a low IC50 toward CbxE PSP, followed by an OP with high affinity for AChE paraoxon or malaoxon, inhibitions of CbxE and AChE were additive. This indicated that CbxE did not protect AChE from OP-induced inhibition in this cell culture model."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"An in vitro model, the aggregating brain cell culture of fetal rat telencephalon, has been used to study the maturation-dependent sensitivity of brain cells to two organophosphorus pesticides OPs, chlorpyrifos and parathion, and to their oxon derivatives. Immature DIV 5-15 or differentiated DIV 25-35 brain cells were treated continuously for 10 days. Acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibitory potency for the OPs was compared to that of eserine physostigmine, a reversible AChE inhibitor. Oxon derivatives were more potent AChE inhibitors than the parent compounds, and parathion was more potent than chlorpyrifos. No maturation-dependent differences for AChE inhibition were found for chlorpyrifos and eserine, whereas for parathion and paraoxon there was a tendency to be more effective in immature cultures, while the opposite was true for chlorpyrifos-oxon. Toxic effects, assessed by measuring protein content as an index of general cytotoxicity, and various enzyme activities as cell-type-specific neuronal and glial markers ChAT and GAD, for cholinergic and GABAergic neurons, respectively, and GS and CNP, for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, respectively were only found at more than 70 of AChE inhibition. Immature compared to differentiated cholinergic neurons appeared to be more sensitive to OP treatments. The oxon derivates were found to be more toxic on neurons than the parent compounds, and chlorpyrifos was more toxic than parathion. Eserine was not neurotoxic. These results indicate that inhibition of AChE remains the most sensitive macromolecular target of OP exposure, since toxic effects were found at concentrations in which AChE was inhibited. Furthermore, the compound-specific reactions, the differential pattern of toxicity of OPs compared to eserine, and the higher sensitivity of immature brain cells suggest that the toxic effects and inhibition of AChE are unrelated."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro modulation of muscarinic autoreceptor function by the organophosphorus OP anticholinesterases chlorpyrifos oxon, paraoxon, and methyl paraoxon. Acetylcholine ACh release was studied by preloading slices from rat striatum with 3Hcholine and depolarizing with potassium 20 mM in perfusion buffer containing hemicholinium-3 to prevent reuptake of radiolabeled choline. Under these conditions, chlorpyrifos oxon, paraoxon, and methyl paraoxon 0.1-10 microM all reduced ACh release in a concentration-dependent manner. Addition of the carbamate acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibitor physostigmine 20 microM to the perfusion buffer also decreased ACh release. When physostigmine was present, the three oxons had no additional effect on ACh release. Concentration-dependent inhibition of AChE activity in striatal slices perfused with chlorpyrifos oxon 0.1, 1, and 10 microM suggested AChE inhibition was responsible for oxon-mediated alterations in ACh release. To differentiate between direct and indirect actions of the OP toxicants on muscarinic autoreceptors, we compared the effects of the oxons on ACh release under two conditions, i.e., tissues were perfused with buffer containing only hemicholinium-3 or with buffer containing hemicholinium-3, physostigmine, and the nonselective muscarinic receptor blocker atropine 100 nM. In the presence of only hemicholinium-3, concentration-dependent inhibition of ACh release was again noted for all oxons, similar to the effects of the muscarinic agonists carbachol and cis-dioxolane. In the presence of physostigmine and atropine, the relative potencies of all agents were markedly reduced. Interestingly, carbachol, cis-dioxolane, paraoxon, and methyl paraoxon all decreased ACh release as before, but chlorpyrifos oxon 100-300 microM actually increased ACh release. Together, the results suggest that chlorpyrifos oxon, paraoxon, and methyl paraoxon can activate muscarinic autoreceptors indirectly through inhibition of AChE. Both paraoxon and methyl paraoxon also directly activate whereas chlorpyrifos oxon blocks muscarinic autoreceptor function. Qualitative differences in the direct actions of these oxons at this presynaptic regulatory site could contribute to differential toxicity with high-dose exposures."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"A PBPK/PD model was developed for the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos CPF O,O-diethyl-O-3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl-phosphorothioate, and the major metabolites CPF-oxon and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol TCP in rats and humans. This model integrates target tissue dosimetry and dynamic response i.e., esterase inhibition describing uptake, metabolism, and disposition of CPF, CPF-oxon, and TCP and the associated cholinesterase ChE inhibition kinetics in blood and tissues following acute and chronic oral and dermal exposure. To facilitate model development, single oral-dose pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in rats 0.5-100 mg/kg and humans 0.5-2 mg/kg, and the kinetics of CPF, CPF-oxon, and TCP were determined, as well as the extent of blood plasma/RBC and brain rats only ChE inhibition. In blood, the concentration of analytes followed the order TCP gtgt CPF gtgt CPF-oxon in humans CPF-oxon was not quantifiable. Simulations were compared against experimental data and previously published studies in rats and humans. The model was utilized to quantitatively compare dosimetry and dynamic response between rats and humans over a range of CPF doses. The time course of CPF and TCP in both species was linear over the dose range evaluated, and the model reasonably simulated the dose-dependent inhibition of plasma ChE, RBC acetylcholinesterase AChE, and brain rat only AChE. Model simulations suggest that rats exhibit greater metabolism of CPF to CPF-oxon than humans do, and that the depletion of nontarget B-esterase is associated with a nonlinear, dose-dependent increase in CPF-oxon blood and brain concentration. This CPF PBPK/PD model quantitatively estimates target tissue dosimetry and AChE inhibition and is a strong framework for further organophosphate OP model development and for refining a biologically based risk assessment for exposure to CPF under a variety of scenarios."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"Acetylcholine ACh release is modulated pre-synaptically by both muscarinic and nicotinic receptor-mediated processes. While muscarinic autoreceptors inhibit ACh release, nicotinic autoreceptors enhance ACh release and thus disruption of these processes could potentially affect cholinergic toxicity following exposure to anticholinesterases. Marked age-related differences in sensitivity to some organophosphorus OP anticholinesterases have been reported. We compared nicotinic autoreceptor function NAF during maturation and aging and evaluated its potential modulation by the common OP insecticide, chlorpyrifos CPF. Cortical synaptosomes were pre-loaded with 3Hcholine, superfused 0.6 ml/min with physiological buffer and 3HACh release was evoked with potassium KCl, 9 mM, with or without co-addition of exogenous ACh to stimulate nicotinic autoreceptors. Fractions of perfusate were subsequently collected and area under the curve AUC for 3H was analyzed by scintillation counting. The difference in evoked release due to co-addition of exogenous ACh was defined as NAF. Under these conditions, atropine ATR, 0.1 microM appeared requisite for NAF thus this muscarinic antagonist was subsequently added to all perfusion buffers. In synaptosomes from adult tissues, exogenous ACh 3-100 microM significantly increased release in a concentration-dependent manner. The nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine MEC, 100 microM substantially reduced the potassium-evoked release elicited by co-addition of ACh 10 microM. Interestingly, the nicotinic agonists nicotine NIC and dimethylphenylpiperazinium DMPP 0.1-10 microM had no effect on release. The active metabolite of CPF i.e. chlorpyrifos oxon CPO, 1-10 microM inhibited NAF in vitro. Maturation-related expression of NAF was noted AUC with co-addition of 10 microM ACh 7-day rats, 7/-6 21-day rats, 44/-6 90-day rats, 196/-37 24-month rats, 173/-52. NAF was substantially reduced 67-91 96 h after maximum tolerated dosages of CPF in adult and aged rats 279 mg/kg, sc but not in juveniles 127 mg/kg, sc, even though AChE inhibition was similar among the age groups gt80. Together these data suggest that NAF is differentially expressed during maturation and that this neuromodulatory process may be selectively altered by some OP insecticides, potentially contributing to age-related differences in response to AChE inhibitors. As NAF has been postulated to be activated under conditions of impaired cholinergic function, selective alteration of this pre-synaptic process by OP anticholinesterases may be also important in age-related conditions associated with cholinergic hypofunction."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos, an acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibitor, is a widely used organophosphate pesticide. Recent concern has focused on its neurotoxicity that is not attributable to AChE inhibition. Here, we report that chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-oxon, but not 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol TCP the breakdown product of chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-oxon, induce apoptosis in primary cortical neurons cultured from embryonic day 17 or newborn rats. It is generally agreed that chlorpyrifos-oxon is approximately three orders of magnitude more potent than chlorpyrifos in inhibition of brain acetylcholinesterase activity. However, our data demonstrate that chlorpyrifos-oxon is only slightly more potent than chlorpyrifos in inducing apoptosis. This indicates that chlorpyrifos-induced apoptosis may occur independently of AChE inhibition, although AChE activity was not measured in this study. Furthermore, chlorpyrifos activates the ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinases. Surprisingly, blocking ERK1/2 activation by the MEK inhibitor SL327 caused a small but statistically significant inhibition of apoptosis, while blocking p38 with SB202190 significantly accelerated apoptosis induced by chlorpyrifos. This suggests a pro- and anti-apoptotic role for ERK1/2 and p38, respectively. Although chlorpyrifos did not stimulate total JNK activity, it caused a sustained activation of a sub-pool of JNK in the nucleus and stimulated phosphorylation of c-Jun, a downstream target of JNK. Transient expression of a dominant negative c-Jun mutant inhibited chlorpyrifos-induced apoptosis, suggesting a role for JNK and JNK-mediated transcription in this cell death. Together, our data suggest apoptosis as a novel toxic endpoint of chlorpyrifos neurotoxicity in the brain that may be independent of AChE inhibition. Furthermore, activation of the ERK1/2 and JNK MAP kinases contributes to, while activation of the p38 MAP kinase counteracts chlorpyrifos-induced apoptosis in cortical neurons."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"The primary mechanism of action for organophosphorus OP insecticides, like chlorpyrifos and parathion, is to inhibit acetylcholinesterase AChE by their oxygenated metabolites oxons, due to the phosphorylation of the serine hydroxyl group located in the active site of the molecule. The rate of phosphorylation is described by the bimolecular inhibitory rate constant ki, which has been used for quantification of OP inhibitory capacity. It has been proposed that a peripheral binding site exists on the AChE molecule, which, when occupied, reduces the capacity of additional oxon molecules to phosphorylate the active site. The aim of this study was to evaluate the interaction of chlorpyrifos oxon CPO and paraoxon PO with rat brain AChE to assess the dynamics of AChE inhibition and the potential role of a peripheral binding site. The ki values for AChE inhibition determined at oxon concentrations of 1-100 nM were 0.206 /- 0.018 and 0.0216 nM-1h-1 for CPO and PO, respectively. The spontaneous reactivation rates of the inhibited AChE for CPO and PO were 0.084-0.087 two determinations and 0.091 /- 0.023 h-1, respectively. In contrast, the ki values estimated at a low oxon concentration 1 pM were approximately 1,000- and 10,000-fold higher than those determined at high CPO and PO concentrations, respectively. At low concentrations, the ki estimates were approximately similar for both CPO and PO 150-180 two determinations and 300 /- 180 nM-1h-1, respectively. This implies that, at low concentrations, both oxons exhibited similar inhibitory potency in contrast to the marked difference exhibited at higher concentrations. These results support the potential importance of a secondary peripheral binding site associated with AChE kinetics, particularly at low, environmentally relevant concentrations."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"Four organophosphorus compounds azinphos-methyl, chlorpyrifos, malathion and malaoxon in aqueous solution were degraded by using a 125 W xenon parabolic lamp. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry GC-MS was used to monitor the disappearance of starting compounds and formation of degradation products as a function of time. AChE-thermal lens spectrometric bioassay was employed to assess the toxicity of photoproducts. The photodegradation kinetics can be described by a first-order degradation curve C=C0e-kt, resulting in the following half lives 2.5min for azinphos-methyl, 11.6 min for malathion, 13.3 min for chlorpyrifos and 45.5 min for malaoxon, under given experimental conditions. During the photoprocess several intermediates were identified by GC-MS suggesting the pathway of OP degradation. The oxidation of chlorpyrifos results in the formation of chlorpyrifos-oxon as the main identified photoproduct. In case of malathion and azinphos-methyl the corresponding oxon analogues were not detected. The formation of diethyl dimethoxy-phosphoryl succinate in traces was observed during photodegradation of malaoxon and malathion. Several other photoproducts including trimethyl phosphate esters, which are known to be AChE inhibitors and 1,2,3-benzotriazin-43H-one as a member of triazine compounds were identified in photodegraded samples of malathion, malaoxon, and azinphos-methyl. Based on this, two main degradation pathways can be proposed, both result of the P-S-C bond cleavage taking place at the side of leaving group. The enhanced inhibition of AChE observed with the TLS bioassay during the initial 30 min of photodegradation in case of all four OPs, confirmed the formation of toxic intermediates. With the continuation of irradiation, the AChE inhibition decreased, indicating that the formed toxic compounds were further degraded to AChE non-inhibiting products. The presented results demonstrate the importance of toxicity monitoring during the degradation of OPs in processes of waste water remediation, before releasing it into the environment."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"In order to enhance the enzymatic detoxification rate of organophosphorus OP nerve agents we have searched for more active variants of recombinant mammalian paraoxonase PON1. We have previously identified three key positions in PON1 that affect OP hydrolysis Leu69, Val346 and His115, that significantly enhance the hydrolysis of cyclosarin GF, soman, chlorpyrifos-oxon ChPo, O-isopropyl-O-p-nitrophenylmethylphosphonate IMP-pNP and diisopropyl fluorophosphate DFP. GC/FPD analysis compared to residual AChE inhibition assay displayed stereoselective hydrolysis of GF, soman and IMP-pNP, indicating that wild type PON1 and its variant V346A are more active toward the less toxic P optical isomer. In order to obtain new PON1 variants with reversed stereoselectivity, displaying augmented activity toward the more toxic isomer P- of nerve agents, we synthesized new asymmetric fluorogenic OPs Flu-OPs. Six Flu-OPs were prepared containing either ethyl E, cyclohexyl C or pinacolyl P alkyl radicals attached to methyl-phosphonyl MP moiety analogous to the structure of VX, GF and soman, respectively. The fluorescent moieties are either 3-cyano-4-methyl-7-hydroxy coumarin MeCyC or 1,3-dichloro-7-hydroxy-9,9-dimethyl-9H-acridin-2-one DDAO. The kinetics of AChE and BChE inhibition by these new Flu-OPs display ki values 8.5x104 to 8.5x107 and 5x104 to 2x106M-1min-1, respectively. EMP-MeCyC and EMP-DDAO are the most active inhibitors of AChE whereas CMP-MeCyC and CMP-DDAO are better inhibitors of BChE than AChE, indicating accommodation of bulky cyclohexyl group inside the active site of BChE. PMP-MeCyC and PMP-DDAO are the least active inhibitors of both AChE and BChE. CMP-MeCyC and CMP-DDAO were significantly detoxified only by the five-site mutations PON1 variant L69V/S138L/S193P/N287D/V346A. Degradation kinetics of Flu-OPs measured by increase in absorbance of the released fluorogenic group was fit by a two exponential function, indicating faster hydrolysis of the less toxic optical isomer. Interestingly, wt PON1 caused only 50 degradation of racemic EMP-MeCyC, CMP-MeCyC and CMP-DDAO indicating complete hydrolysis of P isomer. This remarkable stereoselectivity was used for the enzymatic separation of the P- isomer of CMP-MeCyC. The bimolecular rate constant ki for human AChE inhibition by the isolated P- isomer of CMP-MeCyC is five-fold larger than that of its P isomer. The marked preference of wt PON1 toward P stereo-isomer of CMP-MeCyC and CMP-DDAO renders their P- stereo-isomers suitable for the selection of new OP hydrolase variants with reversed stereoselectivity."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"We have evaluated the potential of plasma albumin to provide a sensitive biomarker of exposure to commonly used organophosphorus pesticides in order to complement the widely used measure of acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition. Rat or human plasma albumin binding by tritiated-diisopropylfluorophosphate 3H-DFP was quantified by retention of albumin on glass microfibre filters. Preincubation with unlabelled pesticide in vitro or dosing of F344 rats with pesticide in vivo resulted in a reduction in subsequent albumin radiolabelling with 3H-DFP, the decrease in which was used to quantify pesticide binding. At pesticide exposures producing approximately 30 inhibition of AChE, rat plasma albumin binding in vitro by azamethiphos oxon, chlorfenvinphos oxon, chlorpyrifos-oxon, diazinon-oxon and malaoxon was reduced from controls by 9/-1, 67/-2, 56/-2, 54/-2 and 8/-1, respectively. After 1 h of incubation with 19 microM 3H-DFP alone, the level of binding to rat or human plasma albumins reached 0.011 or 0.039 moles of DFP per mole of albumin, respectively. This level of binding could be further increased by raising the concentration of 3H-DFP, increasing the 3H-DFP incubation time, or by substitution of commercial albumins for native albumin. Pesticide binding to albumin was presumed covalent since it survived 24 h dialysis. After dosing rats with pirimiphos-methyl dimethoxy or chlorfenvinphos oxon diethoxy pesticides, the resultant albumin binding were still significant 7 days after dosing. As in vitro, dosing of rats with malathion did not result in significant albumin binding in vivo. Our results suggest albumin may be a useful additional biomonitor for moderately low-level exposures to several widely used pesticides, and that this binding differs markedly between pesticides."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"Routine use of tobacco products may modify physiological and metabolic functions, including drug metabolizing enzymes, which may impact the pharmacokinetics of environmental contaminants. Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphorus OP insecticide that is bioactivated to chlorpyrifos-oxon, and manifests its neurotoxicity by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase AChE. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of repeated nicotine exposure on the pharmacokinetics of chlorpyrifos CPF and its major metabolite, 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol TCPy in blood and urine and also to determine the impact on cholinesterase ChE activity in plasma and brain. Animals were exposed to 7-daily doses of either 1mg nicotine/kg or saline, and to either a single oral dose of 35mg CPF/kg or a repeated dose of 5mg CPF/kg/day for 7 days. Groups of rats were then sacrificed at multiple time-points after receiving the last dose of CPF. Repeated nicotine and CPF exposures resulted in enhanced metabolism of CPF to TCPy, as evidenced by increases in the measured TCPy peak concentration and AUC in blood. However, there was no significant difference in the amount of TCPy free or total excreted in the urine within the first 24-h post last dose. The extent of brain acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition was reduced due to nicotine co-exposure consistent with an increase in CYP450-mediated dearylation detoxification versus desulfuration. It was of interest to note that the impact of nicotine co-exposure was experimentally observed only after repeated CPF doses. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for CPF was used to simulate the effect of increasing the dearylation Vmax based upon previously conducted in vitro metabolism studies. Predicted CPF-oxon concentrations in blood and brain were lower following the expected Vmax increase in nicotine treated groups. These model results were consistent with the experimental data. The current study demonstrated that repeated nicotine exposure could alter CPF metabolism in vivo, resulting in altered brain AChE inhibition."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"Previous work in our laboratory has shown that sub-lethal concentrations 1-10 M of chlorpyrifos CPF, diazinon DZ and diazinon oxon DZO inhibit the outgrowth of axon-like neurites in differentiating mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells concomitant with altered levels and/or phosphorylation state of axonal cytoskeleton and growth-associated proteins. The aim of the present work was to determine whether chlorpyrifos oxon CPO was capable of inhibiting N2a cell differentiation in a similar manner. Using experimental conditions similar to our previous work, sub-lethal concentrations 1-10 M of CPO were found to inhibit N2a cell differentiation. However, unlike previous studies with DZ and DZO, there was a high level of sustained inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE in CPO treated cells. Impairment of neurite outgrowth was also associated with reduced levels of growth associated protein-43 and neurofilament heavy chain NFH, and the distribution of NFH in cells stained by indirect immunofluorescence was disrupted. However, in contrast to previous findings for DZO, the absolute level of phosphorylated NFH was unaffected by CPO exposure. Taken together, the findings suggest that sub-lethal concentrations of CPO inhibit axon outgrowth in differentiating N2a cells and that this effect involves reduced levels of two proteins that play key roles in axon outgrowth and maintenance. Although the inhibition of neurite outgrowth is unlikely to involve AChE inhibition directly, further work will help to determine whether the persistent inhibition of AChE by CPO can account for the different effects induced by CPO and DZO on the levels of total and phosphorylated NFH."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"Organophosphorus OP compounds are a diverse chemical group that includes nerve agents and pesticides. They share a common chemical signature that facilitates their binding and adduction of acetylcholinesterase AChE within nerve synapses to induce cholinergic toxicity. However, this group diversity results in non-uniform binding and inactivation of other secondary protein targets, some of which may be adducted and protein activity influenced, even when only a relatively minor portion of tissue AChE is inhibited. The determination of individual OP protein binding targets has been hampered by the sensitivity of methods of detection and quantification of protein-pesticide adducts. We have overcome this limitation by the employment of a microchannel plate MCP autoradiographic detector to monitor a radiolabelled OP tracer compound. We preincubated rat thymus tissue in vitro with the OP pesticides, azamethiphos-oxon, chlorfenvinphos-oxon, chlorpyrifos-oxon, diazinon-oxon, and malaoxon, and then subsequently radiolabelled the free OP binding sites remaining with 3H-diisopropylfluorophosphate 3H-DFP. Proteins adducted by OP pesticides were detected as a reduction in 3H-DFP radiolabelling after protein separation by one dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantitative digital autoradiography using the MCP imager. Thymus tissue proteins of molecular weights -28 kDa, 59 kDa, 66 kDa, and 82 kDa displayed responsiveness to adduction by this panel of pesticides. The 59 kDa protein target previously putatively identified as carboxylesterase I was only significantly adducted by chlorfenvinphos-oxon p lt 0.001, chlorpyrifos-oxon p lt 0.0001, and diazinon-oxon p lt 0.01, the 66 kDa protein target previously identified as serum albumin similarly only adducted by the same three pesticides p lt 0.0001, p lt 0.001, and p lt 0.01, and the 82 kDa protein target previously identified as acyl peptide hydrolase only adducted by chlorpyrifos-oxon p lt 0.0001 and diazinon-oxon p lt 0.001, when the average values of tissue AChE inhibition were 30, 35, and 32 respectively. The -28 kDa protein target was shown to be heterogeneous in nature and was resolved to reveal nineteen 3H-DFP radiolabelled protein spots by two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and MCP autoradiography. Some of these 3H-DFP proteins spots were responsive to adduction by preincubation with chlorfenvinphos-oxon. In addition, we exploited the useful spatial resolution of the MCP imager -70 mm to determine pesticide micolocalisation in vivo, after animal dosing and autoradiography of brain tissue sections. Collectively, MCP autoradiographic imaging provided a means to detect targets of OP pesticides, quantify their sensitivity of adduction relative to tissue AChE inhibition, and highlighted that these common pesticides exhibit specific binding character to protein targets, and therefore their toxicity will need to be evaluated on an individual compound basis. In addition, MCP autoradiography afforded a useful method of visualisation of the localisation of a small radiolabelled tracer within brain tissue."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase AChE and butyrylcholinesterase BChE activity is an established biomarker of exposure to organophosphorus poisons OP. Inhibition of activity is due to covalent binding of the OP to the active site serine. Mass spectrometry has made it possible to monitor OP exposure by analyzing OP adducts on tyrosine in proteins that have no active site serine. Our goal was to test the hypothesis that OP-tyrosine may serve as a biomarker of OP exposure in mice. A MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry strategy to analyze diethoxyphosphate-tyrosine of m/z 318 was developed. The adduct was synthesized by incubating l-tyrosine with chlorpyrifos oxon at pH 8.1. The adduct eluted from a reverse phase HPLC column with 22-23 acetonitrile. The fragmentation spectrum of the m/z 318 precursor ion confirmed its identity as diethoxyphosphate-tyrosine. Diethoxyphosphate-tyrosine was isolated from chlorpyrifos oxon treated mouse albumin after digesting the protein with pronase. Mice n=3 per group were treated with a nontoxic dose of chlorpyrifos oxon 3 mg/kg and a toxic dose 10 mg/kg transdermally. The pronase digested plasma yielded diethoxyphosphate-tyrosine up to 120 h after treatment with 3 mg/kg chlorpyrifos oxon and up to 144 h after 10 mg/kg. In contrast plasma AChE activity returned to normal after 24-72 h. In conclusion MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry can be used to diagnose exposure to chlorpyrifos oxon days after AChE inhibition assays are uninformative.
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos CPF, one of the most widely-used organophosphorus OP insecticides in agriculture, is degraded in the field to its oxon form, chlorpyrifos-oxon CPO, which can represent a significant contaminant in exposures to adults and children. CPO is also responsible for the acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition associated with CPF exposures CPF is converted by liver CYP450 enzymes to CPO, which binds to and inhibits AChE and other serine active-site esterases, lipases and proteases. Young children represent a particularly susceptible population for exposure to CPF and CPO, in part because levels of the plasma enzyme, paraoxonase PON1, which hydrolyzes CPO, are very low during early development. While a number of studies have demonstrated developmental neurotoxicity associated with CPF exposure, including effects at or below the threshold levels for AChE inhibition, it is unclear whether these effects were due directly to CPF or to its active metabolite, CPO. PON1 knockout PON1-/- mice, which lack PON1, represent a highly sensitive mouse model for toxicity associated with exposure to CPF or CPO. To examine the neurobehavioral consequences of CPO exposure during postnatal development, PON1-/- mice were exposed daily from PND 4 to PND 21 to CPO at 0.15, 0.18, or 0.25 mg/kg/d. A neurobehavioral test battery did not reveal significant effects of CPO on early reflex development, motor coordination, pre-pulse inhibition of startle, startle amplitude, open field behavior, or learning and memory in the contextual fear conditioning, Morris water maze, or water radial-arm maze tests. However, body weight gain and startle latency were significantly affected by exposure to 0.25 mg/kg/d CPO. Additionally, from PNDs 15-20 the mice exposed repeatedly to CPO at all three doses exhibited a dose-related transient hyperkinesis in the 20-min period following CPO administration, suggesting possible effects on catecholaminergic neurotransmission. Our previous study demonstrated wide-ranging effects of neonatal CPO exposure on gene expression in the brain and on brain AChE inhibition, and modulation of both of these effects by the PON1Q192R polymorphism. The current study indicates that the neurobehavioral consequences of these effects are more elusive, and suggests that alternative neurobehavioral tests might be warranted, such as tests of social interactions, age-dependent effects on learning and memory, or tests designed specifically to assess dopaminergic or noradrenergic function."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"This study assessed the in vitro and in vivo effects of an acetylcholinesterase enzyme inhibitor chlorpyrifos in two estuarine crustaceans grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio and mysid Americamysis bahia. The differences in response were quantified after lethal and sublethal exposures to chlorpyrifos and in vitro assays with chlorpyrifos-oxon. Results from the in vitro experiments indicated that the target enzyme, acetylcholinesterase AChE, in the two species was similar in sensitivity to chlorpyrifos inhibition with IC50s of 0.98 nM and 0.89 nM for grass shrimp and mysids, respectively. In vivo experiments showed that mysids were significantly more sensitive to chlorpyrifos-induced AChE inhibition after 24 h of exposure. The in vivo EC50s for AChE inhibition were 1.23 g L-1 for grass shrimp and 0.027 g L-1 for mysids. Median lethal concentrations 24h LC50 values were 1.06 g L-1 for grass shrimp and 0.068 g L-1 for mysids. The results suggest that differences in the response of these two crustaceans are likely related to differences in uptake and metabolism rather than target site sensitivity."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"In fish, a number of studies have linked acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition with exposure to organophosphate pesticides OPs however, evidence suggests the need to study aspects related to the bioactivation and detoxification of OPs, since their neurotoxicity is dependent on these processes. Thus, the study aim was to examine the relations between chlorpyrifos CPF and diazinon DZN bioactivation by hepatic CYP450 izoenzymes CYP 2B6, CYP 2C19, CYP 3A4 and detoxification by aryl esterases and oxonases with brain and muscle AChE activity in Chirostoma jordani from three lakes with low to high OPs contamination in water and sediments. We found two patterns of bioactivation in vitro i in fish from a lake with high CPF pollution, the main isoenzymes involved in this process were CYP 2C19gtCYP 2B6gtCYP 3A4, and ii in fish captured in a lake with a high concentration of DZN, the isoenzymes were CYP 3A4gtCYP 2C19gtCYP 2B6. Bioactivation is shown in this study to be fundamental in brain and muscle AChE inhibition in vivo. The rate of bioactivation of CPF was lower than for DZN. CPF bioactivation was accompanied by reduced detoxification and higher neurotoxicity, which was inversely dependent on the environmental contamination of CPF. Detoxification was also inversely correlated with environmental contamination by CPF, and was higher with diazoxon than chlorpyrifos-oxon. Oxonases were the most relevant enzymes involved in detoxification. The current findings suggest a series of strategies between the bioactivation and detoxification of OPs that allowed the survival of C. jordani despite of OPs pollution levels."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"Acetylcholinesterase AChE is an enzyme responsible for metabolism of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and inhibition of AChE can have therapeutic applications e.g., drugs for Alzheimers disease or neurotoxic consequences e.g., pesticides. A common absorbance-based AChE activity assay that uses 5,5-dithiobis2-nitrobenzoic acid DTNB can have limited sensitivity and be prone to interference. Therefore, an alternative assay was developed, in which AChE activity was determined by measuring fluorescence of resorufin produced from coupled enzyme reactions involving acetylcholine and Amplex Red 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine. The Amplex Red assay was used for two separate applications. First, AChE activity was measured in rat whole blood, which is a biomarker for exposure to AChE inhibitor pesticides. Activity was quantified from a 105-fold dilution of whole blood, and there was a linear correlation between Amplex Red and DTNB assays. For the second application, Amplex Red assay was used to measure AChE inhibition potency in a human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, which is important for assessing pharmacological and toxicological potential of AChE inhibitors including drugs, phytochemicals, and pesticides. Five known reversible inhibitors were evaluated IC50, 7-225 nM, along with irreversible inhibitors chlorpyrifos-oxon ki=1.01 nM-1h-1 and paraoxon ki=0.16 nM-1h-1. Lastly, in addition to inhibition, AChE reactivation was measured in SH-SY5Y cells incubated with pralidoxime chloride 2-PAM. The Amplex Red assay is a sensitive, specific, and reliable fluorescence method for measuring AChE activity in both rat whole blood and cultured SH-SY5Y cells."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"The internal concentration of chemicals in exposed organisms changes over time due to absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion processes since chemicals are taken up from the environment. Internal concentration and time are very important modifiers of toxicity when biomarkers are used to evaluate the potential hazards and risks of environmental pollutants. In this study, the responses of molecular biomarkers, and the fate of chemicals in the body, were comprehensively investigated to determine cause-and-effect relationships over time. Chlorpyrifos CP was selected as a model chemical, and Caenorhabditis elegans was exposed to CP for 4 h using the passive dosing method. Worms were then monitored in fresh medium during a 48-h recovery regime. The mRNA expression of genes related to CYP metabolism cyp35a2 and cyp35a3 increased during the constant exposure phase. The body residue of CP decreased once it reached a peak level during the early stage of exposure, indicating that the initial uptake of CP rapidly induced biotransformation with the synthesis of new CYP metabolic proteins. The residual chlorpyrifos-oxon concentration, an acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibitor, continuously increased even after the recovery regime started. These delayed toxicokinetics seem to be important for the extension of AChE inhibition for up to 9 h after the start of the recovery regime. Comprehensive investigation into the molecular initiation events and changes in the internal concentrations of chemical species provide insight into response causality within the framework of an adverse outcome pathway."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"In chemical risk assessment, default uncertainty factors are used to account for interspecies and interindividual differences, and differences in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics herein. However, these default factors come with little scientific support. Therefore, our aim was to develop an in vitro method, using acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibition as a proof of principle, to assess both interspecies and interindividual differences in toxicodynamics. Electric eel enzyme and human blood of 20 different donors 12 men/8 women were exposed to eight different compounds chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-oxon, phosmet, phosmet-oxon, diazinon, diazinon-oxon, pirimicarb, rivastigmine and inhibition of AChE was measured using the Ellman method. The organophosphate parent compounds, chlorpyrifos, phosmet and diazinon, did not show inhibition of AChE. All other compounds showed concentration-dependent inhibition of AChE, with IC50s in human blood ranging from 0.2-29 M and IC20s ranging from 0.1-18 M, indicating that AChE is inhibited at concentrations relevant to the in vivo human situation. The oxon analogues were more potent inhibitors of electric eel AChE compared to human AChE. The opposite was true for carbamates, pointing towards interspecies differences for AChE inhibition. Human interindividual variability was low and ranged from 5-25, depending on the concentration. This study provides a reliable in vitro method for assessing human variability in AChE toxicodynamics. The data suggest that the default uncertainty factor of  3.16 may overestimate human variability for this toxicity endpoint, implying that specific toxicodynamic-related adjustment factors can support quantitative in vitro to in vivo extrapolations that link kinetic and dynamic data to improve chemical risk assessment."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos CPF is a widely used broad-spectrum organophosphate insecticide. CPF elicits neurotoxic effects in exposed organisms by inhibiting the activity of acetylcholinesterase enzymes AChE, which prolongs nerve transmission and results in neurotoxic symptoms and death at high doses. While CPF is capable of eliciting neurotoxic effects, chlorpyrifos-oxon CPFO is the primary neurotoxicant agent. Aquatic organisms bioactivate CPF to CPFO through the Cytochrome P450 phase I metabolic pathway following exposure to CPF. Additionally, in the environment, CPF transforms to CPFO, primarily through photo-oxidation. As both compounds can be transported in air and water to aquatic ecosystems, there is the potential for exposure to non-target organisms. The potential for adverse impacts on aquatic receptors depends on patterns of exposure and toxicity of individual compounds and the mixture. To study the neurotoxicity of these compounds, a 48 h acute and 21 d chronic Daphnia magna bioassay was conducted independently with CPF and CPFO. Acute bioassay results show a median lethal concentration LC50 of 0.76 g L-1 for CPF and 0.32 g L-1 for CPFO, suggesting that CPFO is 2.4 times more acutely toxic to D. magna. Acute assay results were also used to derive Benchmark Dose Levels of 0.58 g L-1 for CPF and 0.25 g L-1 for CPFO. However, neither compound elicited an effect on reproduction or growth at relevant chronic exposures. As D. magna are a small and relatively sensitive species, and the AChE inhibition adverse outcome pathway is highly conserved, these results may be cautiously extrapolated in assessing adverse impacts on aquatic receptors.1."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"A sensitive assay was developed to evaluate inhibitory effects of aqueous solution on acetylcholinesterase AChE activity via measuring hydrolysis rates of acetylcholine ACh based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry UPLC-MS/MS. Upon having identified precursor ions and product ions of the ACh and its hydrolysis products choline Ch, the separation chromatogram for these two analytes has been established using a 50 mm reverse-phase BEH Shield RP18 column. The total chromatographic separation time is 7 min limits of detection LODs for ACh and Ch are 0.14 g L-1 and 0.12 g L-1, respectively. A simple method for inactivation of AChE and optimization of operational parameters were then sequentially performed. It was found that adjusting solution pH to 2.5 not only can terminate the enzymatic reaction but also solve band shifting and broadening caused by aqueous matrices in chromatographic separation during UPLC-MS/MS detection. Under conditions of 0.00075 U mL-1 AChE, initial concentration of ACh at 100 g L-1 and 20 min observation time, IC50 values of the proposed assay for chlorpyrifos-oxon, diazoxon, malaoxon, methidathion oxon, omethoate and paraoxon were 3.5 nM, 16.8 nM, 2.4 nM, 6.8 nM, 270 nM and 36.9 nM, respectively. They are 4.5-51.9 times smaller than those reported in a LC-MS based method, and gt120 times lower than those obtained by the traditional Ellman method. The results suggested that, the proposed assay significantly increases the sensitivity of commercial AChE. In addition, inhibition efficiencies of three surface waters, a groundwater and four commercial brands of bottled drinking water samples on AChE activity were firstly measured using this UPLC-MS/MS based method. These water samples were proved to have different inhibitory effects on AChE activity, and the inhibition efficiencies dependent on concentrations of dissolved organic carbon DOC but are independent of UV absorbance at 254 nm UV254 values. These results indicate that the proposed method has advantages of high sensitivity over all other conventional methods. It may become a promising AChE inhibition assay for assessing toxicity of aqueous solution containing neurotoxicity contaminants such as organophosphorus pesticides OPPs at low levels, or used to evaluate potential inhibition effects of natural waters on AChE activity."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"Currently, there is a lack of knowledge about the effects of co-exposures of cannabis, contaminated with pesticides like chlorpyrifos CPF and the toxic metabolite CPF-oxon CPFO. CPF/CPFO residues, and 9Tetrahydrocannabinol 9THC, the main component in cannabis, are known to disrupt the endocannabinoid system eCBS resulting in neurodevelopmental defects. Although there are in vivo data characterizing CPF/CPFO and 9THC, there are mechanistic data gaps and deficiencies. In this study, an investigation of open access CompTox tools and ToxCast/Tox21 data was performed to determine targets relating to the modes of action MOA for these compounds and, given the available biological targets, predict points of departure POD. The main findings were as follows 1 In vivo PODs for each chemical were from open literature, 2 Concordance between ToxCast/Tox21 assay targets and known targets in the metabolic and eCBS pathways was evaluated, 3 Human Equivalent Administered Dose EADHuman PODs showed the High throughput toxicokinetic HTTK 3 compartment model 3COMP was more predictive of in vivo PODs than the PBTK model for CPF, CPFO and 9THC, 4 Age-adjusted 3COMP HTTK-Pop EADHuman, with CPF and CPFO ToxCast/Tox21 AC50 values as inputs were predictive for ages 0-4 when but not 9THC compared to in vivo PODs. 5 Age-related refinements for CPF/CPFO were primarily from ToxCast/Tox21 active hit-calls for nuclear receptors, CYP2B6 and AChE inhibition CPFO only associated with the metabolic pathway. Only one assay target arylhydrocarbon hydroxylase receptor was common between CPF/CPFO and 9THC. While computational refinements may select some sensitive events involved in the metabolic pathways this is highly dependent on the cytotoxicity limits, availability of metabolic activity in the ToxCast/Tox21 assays and reliability of assay performance. Some uncertainties and data gaps for 9THC might be addressed with assays specific to the eCBS. For CPF, assays with appropriate metabolic activation could better represent the toxic pathway."
Chlorpyrifos-oxon,AChE inhibition,"Chlorpyrifos CP and its highly electrophilic intermediates are principal toxic metabolites. The active form of CP i.e. chlorpyrifos oxon CP-oxon is responsible for both the insecticidal activity and is also of greater risk when present in the atmosphere. Thus, the combined effects of both CP, CP-oxan, and other metabolites enhance our understanding of the safety and risk of the insecticide CP. They cause major toxicities such as AChE inhibition, oxidative stress, and endocrine disruption. Further, it can have adverse hematological, musculoskeletal, renal, ocular, and dermal effects. Excessive use of this compound results in poisoning and potentially kills a non-target species upon exposure including humans. Several examples of reactive metabolites toxicities on plants, aquatic life, and soil are presented herein. The review covers the general overview on reactive metabolites of CP, chemistry and their mechanism through toxic effects on humans as well as on the environment. Considerable progress has been made in the replacement or alternative to CP. The different strategies including antidote mechanisms for the prevention and treatment of CP poisoning are discussed in this review. The approach analyses also the active metabolites for the pesticide activity and thus it becomes more important to know the pesticide and toxicity dose of CP as much as possible."
Clofibric acid,COX-2 inhibition,"Overexpression of the inducible cyclooxygenase COX-2 and inducible NO synthase iNOS in activated brain macrophages microglia and astrocytes appears central to many neuroinflammatory conditions. 15-Deoxy-Delta12,14-PGJ2 15d-PGJ2 is a ligand for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPARgamma. It has been proposed as an inhibitor of microglial activation, based on the study of iNOS down-regulation in rodent microglia. Because iNOS induction after cytokine activation remains controversial in human microglia, we examined the effect of 15d-PGJ2 and other PPAR agonists on human microglia and astrocytes, using COX-2 induction as an index of activation. We found that PPAR alpha ligands clofibrate and WY14643 enhanced IL-1 beta-induced COX-2 expression in human astrocytes and microglia, while inhibiting IL-1 beta plus IFN-gamma induction of iNOS in astrocytes. This is the first description of an inhibition of iNOS uncoupled from that of COX-2. 15d-PGJ2 suppressed COX-2 induction in human astrocytes. It prevented NF-kappa B binding to the COX-2 promoter through a new pathway that is the repression of NF-kappa Bp50 induction by IL-1 beta. In contrast, 15d-PGJ2 increased c-Jun and c-Fos DNA-binding activity in astrocytes, which may result in the activation of other inflammatory pathways. In human microglia, no effect of 15d-PGJ2 on COX-2 and NF-kappa Bp65/p50 induction was observed. However, the entry of 15d-PGJ2 occurred in microglia because STAT-1 and c-Jun expression was modulated. Our data suggest the existence of novel pathways mediated by 15d-PGJ2 in human astrocytes. They also demonstrate that, unlike astrocytes and peripheral macrophages or rodent brain macrophages, human microglia are not subject to the anti-inflammatory effect of 15d-PGJ2 in terms of COX-2 inhibition."
Clofibric acid, increased the formation of palmitic acid (16:0)-18:1 PE,"The biogenesis of peroxisomes in relation to the trafficking of proteins to peroxisomes has been extensively examined. However, the supply of phospholipids, which is needed to generate peroxisomal membranes in mammals, remains unclear. Therefore, we herein investigated metabolic alterations induced by clofibric acid, a peroxisome proliferator, in the synthesis of phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) molecular species, and their relationship with the biogenesis of peroxisomal membranes. The subcutaneous administration of clofibric acid to rats at a relatively low dose (130 mg/kg) once a day time-dependently and gradually increased the integrated perimeter of peroxisomes per 100 ?m2Â hepatocyte cytoplasm (PA). A strong correlation was observed between the content (?mol/mg DNA) of PE containing arachidonic acid (20:4) and PA (r2Â = 0.9168). Moreover, the content of PE containing octadecenoic acid (18:1) positively correlated with PA (r2Â = 0.8094). The treatment with clofibric acid markedly accelerated the formation of 16:0-20:4 PE by increasing the production of 20:4 and the activity of acyl chain remodeling of pre-existing PE molecular species. Increases in the acyl chain remodeling of PE by clofibric acid were mainly linked to the up-regulated expression of the Lpcat3 gene. On the other hand, clofibric acid markedly increased the formation of palmitic acid (16:0)-18:1 PE through de novo synthesis. These results suggest that the enhanced formation of particular PE molecular species is related to increases in the mass of peroxisomal membranes in peroxisome proliferation in the liver"

Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Stably transfected Jurkat T cells were produced in which Bax expression is inducible by muristerone A. The cell death resulting from induction of the overexpression of Bax was prevented by inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition MPT with cyclosporin A CyA in combination with the phospholipase A2 inhibitor aristolochic acid ArA. The caspase-3 inhibitor Z-Asp-Glu-Val aspartic acid fluoromethylketone Z-DEVD-FMK had no effect on the loss of viability. The MPT was measured as the CyA plus ArA-preventable loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential DeltaPsim. The MPT was accompanied by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, caspase-3 activation in the cytosol, cleavage of the nuclear enzyme polyADP-ribosepolymerase PARP, and DNA fragmentation, all of which were inhibited by CyA plus ArA. Z-DEVD-FMK had no effect on the loss of DeltaPsim and the redistribution of cytochrome c but did prevent caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, and DNA fragmentation. It is concluded that Bax induces the MPT, a critical event in the loss of cell viability. In addition to the cell death, the MPT mediates other typical manifestations of apoptosis in this model, namely release of cytochrome c, caspase activation with PARP cleavage, and DNA fragmentation."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Ischemia reperfusion IR and cyclosporine A CsA injuries are unavoidable in kidney transplantation and are associated with allograft dysfunction. Herein, the effect and mechanism of a novel tissue protective peptide, helix B surface peptide HBSP derived from erythropoietin, were investigated in a rat model. The right kidney was subjected to 45 min ischemia, followed by left nephrectomy and 2-week reperfusion, with or without daily treatment of CsA 25 mg/kg and/or HBSP 8 nmol/kg. Blood urea nitrogen was increased by CsA but decreased by HBSP at 1 week and 2 weeks, while the same changes were revealed in urinary protein/creatinine only at 2 weeks. HBSP also significantly ameliorated tubulointerstitial damage and interstitial fibrosis, which were gradually increased by IR and CsA. In addition, apoptotic cells, infiltrated inflammatory cells, and active caspase-3 cells were greatly reduced by HBSP in the both IR and IR  CsA groups. The 17 kD active caspase-3 protein was decreased by HBSP in the IR and IR  CsA kidneys, with decreased mRNA only in the IR  CsA kidneys. Taken together, it has been demonstrated, for the first time, that HBSP effectively improved renal function and tissue damage caused by IR and/or CsA, which might be through reducing caspase-3 activation and synthesis, apoptosis, and inflammation."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"1. Activation of macrophages with lipopolysaccharide LPS and low doses of interferon-gamma IFN-gamma induced apoptotic death through a nitric oxide-dependent pathway. 2. Treatment of cells with the immunosuppressors cyclosporin A CsA or FK506 inhibited the activation-dependent apoptosis. 3. These drugs decreased the up-regulation of p53 and Bax characteristic of activated macrophages. Moreover, incubation of activated macrophages with CsA and FK506 contributed to maintain higher levels of Bcl-2 than in LPS/IFN-gamma treated cells. 4. The inhibition of apoptosis exerted by CsA and FK506 in macrophages was also observed when cell death was induced by treatment with chemical nitric oxide donors. 5. Incubation of macrophages with LPS/IFN-gamma barely affected caspase-1 but promoted an important activation of caspase-3. Both CsA and FK506 inhibited pathways leading to caspase-3 activation. Moreover, the cleavage of polyADP-ribose polymerase, a well established caspase substrate, was reduced by these immunosuppressive drugs. 6. CsA and FK506 reduced the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol and the activation of caspase-3 in cells treated with nitric oxide donors. 7. These results indicate that CsA and FK506 protect macrophages from nitric oxide-dependent apoptosis and suggest a contribution of the macrophage to innate immunity under conditions of immunosuppression of the host."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Costimulation of T cells via CD28 promotes both proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. In this study, we show that the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A CsA fully reverses resistance to CD95-mediated cell death after TCR/CD28 costimulation or superagonistic anti-CD28 mAb stimulation of primary rat lymph node T cells. This effect correlated with a pronounced superinduction of caspase-3 on both mRNA and protein levels, whereas its main antagonist, X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, was unaffected by inclusion of CsA. Apoptosis triggered by CD95 cross-linking was characterized by robust caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, CsA sensitization to CD95-mediated apoptosis of CD28-activated T cells did not alter mRNA stability of superinduced caspase-3 mRNA, suggesting a transcriptional regulation of the caspase-3 gene. Addition of Ca2 ionophores to TCR/CD28 or superagonistic CD28-stimulated cells reduced caspase-3 levels, further supporting a role for Ca2-dependent signaling pathways in negatively regulating caspase-3. Taken together, these findings suggest that CsA promotes sensitivity to CD95-mediated apoptosis in CD28-stimulated T cells by superinduction of the caspase-3 gene via a mechanism involving suppression of the calcineurin pathway."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Calcineurin is selectively enriched within neurons of the central nervous system. The mechanism of calcineurin inhibitor-induced neurotoxicity remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study is to examine whether glycogen synthase-3 GSK-3 is involved in calcineurin inhibitor-induced apoptosis. Calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine A CsA and FK506 increased apoptotic cell death with morphological changes characterized by cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation of fragmentation, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Alsteropaullone and 1-azakenpaullone, GSK-3 inhibitors, prevented calcineurin inhibitor-induced apoptosis. In addition, insulin growth factor-I IGF-I and cycloheximide completely blocked cell death. Moreover, caspase-3 activation was accompanied by calcineurin inhibitor-induced cell death. These results suggest that calcineurin inhibitors induce caspase-dependent apoptosis and activation of GSK-3 is involved in cell death in rat cortical neurons."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Protein phosphatase PP activity is associated with the regulation of apoptosis in neutrophils. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms in apoptosis remain unclear. The type of cell death induced by okadaic acid OA, the inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A, is characterized by apoptotic morphological changes of the cells and annexin V-positive staining without DNA fragmentation. The apoptotic effects of OA and calyculin A on neutrophils were observed at concentrations ranging from 50 to 200 nM, or 10 to 50 nM, respectively. Cyclosporine A a PP2B specific inhibitor, however, did not exhibit any pro-apoptotic effects. OA and calyculin A, but not cyclosporine A, exhibited significant effects on protein levels and on the electrophoretic mobility of Mcl-1. zVAD-fmk, a pancaspase inhibitor, failed to inhibit the effect of OA on the caspase-3 activity, procaspase-3 processing, and the apoptotic rate of neutrophils. However, 4-2-aminoethyl benzenesulfonylfluoride AEBSF, a general serine protease inhibitor, significantly abrogated the OA-induced mobility shift in procaspase-3, caspase-3 activation, and the apoptotic morphological changes in neutrophils. Moreover, OA enhanced the serine protease activity of the neutrophils. The addition of the proteinase-3 protein increased the rate of neutrophil apoptosis, which was also blocked by AEBSF but not by zVAD-fmk. These results suggest that OA induces procaspase-3 processing but that OA-induced apoptosis is caspase-independent and serine protease-dependent."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Timosaponin A-III TAIII, a saponin isolated from the rhizome of Anemarrhena asphodeloides, exhibits potent cytotoxicity and has the potential to be developed as an anticancer agent. Here, we provide evidence that TAIII induces autophagy in HeLa cells followed by apoptotic cell death. TAIII-induced autophagy was morphologically characterized by the formation of membrane-bound autophagic vacuoles recognizable at the ultrastructural level. TAIII-treated cells expressing green fluorescent protein GFP-labeled microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 LC3 displayed punctate fluorescence indicative of LC3 recruitment to the autophagosome. This was associated with the conversion of LC3-I the cytosolic form into LC3-II the lipidated form located on the autophagosome membrane. TAIII treatment also induced mitochondrial dysfunction involving overproduction of reactive oxygen species and reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential accompanied by induction of mitochondrial permeability transition. Prolonged exposure to TAIII resulted in cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation, events that signified the onset of apoptotic cell death. TAIII-induced autophagy preceded apoptosis, as evidenced by early autophagic vacuole formation, GFP-LC3 translocation, and LC3-II increase in the absence of caspase-3 cleavage. Notably, TAIII-mediated apoptotic cell death was potentiated by treatment with autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine or small interfering RNA against the autophagic gene beclin 1. These findings suggest that TAIII-elicited autophagic response plays a protective role that impedes the eventual cell death. In terms of structure-activity relationship, the sugar chain in TAIII is indispensable to the drug action, as the sugar-lacking aglycone sarsasapogenin did not induce autophagy and exhibited weaker cytotoxicity."
Cyclosporin A,PPARgamma activation,"Recent studies demonstrated that endoplasmic reticulum ER stress regulates glucose homeostasis and that ER stress preconditioning which induces an adaptive, protective unfolded protein response UPR offers cytoprotection against nephrotoxins. Thus the aim of the present study was to use renal proximal tubule cells PTCs to further elucidate the link between the BSA-induced ER stress and alpha-methyl-d-glucopyranoside alpha-MG uptake and to identify related signaling pathways. Among ER stress inducers such as high glucose, BSA, H2O2, or tumicamycin, BSA pretreatment ameliorated the reduction of Na-glucose cotransporter SGLT expression and alpha-MG uptake by gentamicin or cyclosporine A. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that BSA 10 mg/ml stimulated the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 GRP78, an ER stress biomarker. In addition, BSA increased levels of GRP78 protein expression and eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha eIF2alpha phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, transfection with a GRP78-specific small interfering RNA siRNA inhibited BSA-stimulated SGLT expression and alpha-MG uptake. In experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms underlying BSA-induced ER stress, BSA stimulated the production of cellular reactive oxygen species ROS, and antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or N-acetylcysteine NAC blocked BSA-induced increases in GRP78 activation, eIF2alpha phosphorylation, SGLT expression, and alpha-MG uptake. Moreover, the cells upregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma PPARgamma mRNA levels in response to BSA or troglitazone a PPARgamma agonist, but BSA was ineffective in the presence of GW9662 a PPARgamma antagonist. In addition, both BSA and troglitazone stimulated GRP78 and eIF2alpha activation, SGLT expression, and alpha-MG uptake, whereas GW9662 inhibited the effects of BSA. BSA also stimulated phosphorylation of JNK and NF-kappaB, and GW9662 or GRP78 siRNA attenuated this response. Moreover, SP600125 or SN50 effectively blocked SGLT expression and alpha-MG uptake in BSA- or PPARgamma agonists troglitazone or PGJ2-treated PTCs. We conclude that BSA induces ER stress through ROS production and PPARgamma activation, which subsequently activates JNK/NF-kappaB signaling to enhance glucose uptake in renal PTCs."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Okadaic acid OA is a specific and potent protein phosphatase inhibitor and tumor promoter. The present study establishes the role of reactive oxygen species ROS and mitogen activated protein kinases in cell death induced by okadaic acid. The study showed that okadaic acid is cytotoxic at 10 nM with an IC50 of 100 nM in U-937 cells. The CVDE assay and mitochondrial dehydrogenase assay showed a time dependent cytotoxicity. The phase contrast visualization of the OA treated cells showed the apoptotic morphology and was confirmed with esterase staining for plasma membrane integrity. OA activated caspases-7, 9 and 3, PARP cleavage and induced nuclear damage in a time and dose dependent manner. Compromised mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome-c and apoptosis inducing factor confirms the involvement of mitochondria. A time dependent decrease in glutathione levels and a dose dependent increase in ROS with maximum at 30 min were observed. ROS scavenger-N-acetyl cysteine, mitochondrial stabilizer-cyclosporin-A, and broad spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK inhibited the OA induced caspase-3 activation, DNA damage and cell death but caspase-8 inhibitor had no effect. OA activated p38 MAPK and JNK in a time dependent manner, but not ERK. MAP kinase inhibitors SB203580, SP600125 and PD98059 confirm the role of p38 MAPK and JNK in OA induced caspase-3 activation and cell death. Over all, our results indicate that OA induces cell death by generation of ROS, and activation of p38 MAPK and JNK, and executed through mitochondrial mediated caspase pathway."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Massive hepatectomy MHX leads to failure of remnant livers. Excessive metabolic burden in remnant livers may cause mitochondrial dysfunction. This study investigated whether blockade of the mitochondrial permeability transition MPT with N-methyl-4-isoleucine cyclosporine NIM811 improves the outcome of MHX.   METHODS Mice were gavaged with NIM811 10 mg/kg before surgery and 5 mg/kg daily afterward and underwent sham-operation or approximately 90 partial hepatectomy.   RESULTS Serum alanine aminotransferase, necrosis, and apoptosis increased, respectively, to approximately 1200 U/L, 6.1, and 7 after MHX. NIM811 decreased peak alanine aminotransferase release, necrosis, and apoptosis by 70, 100, and 42, respectively. 5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation, proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, and the remnant liver weights were all increased significantly by NIM811 treatment, indicating improved liver regeneration. NIM811 also blunted hyperbilirubinemia by 54, increased serum albumin by 51, and improved survival from 6 to 40 after MHX. Hepatic mitochondrial depolarization, cell death, and MPT were detected by intravital confocal/multiphoton microscopy of rhodamine 123, propidium iodide, and calcein. Mitochondrial depolarization occurred in many viable hepatocytes 13 cells/high-power field, and nonviable hepatocytes increased slightly to approximately 1 cell/high-power field at 3 hr after MHX. Entry of calcein into mitochondria after MHX indicated MPT onset. Importantly, NIM811 decreased mitochondria depolarization by more than 60, blocked MPT onset, and prevented cell death. Decreases of hepatic ATP, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activation after MHX were also partially blocked by NIM811.   CONCLUSIONS NIM811 minimized liver injury and improved liver regeneration after MHX, at least in part, by preventing MPT onset and subsequent compromised energy supply and proapoptotic cytochrome c release."
Cyclosporin A,estrogen receptor activity,"Mammalian liver contains receptors for both estrogens and androgens. Hepatic regeneration after partial hepatectomy in male rats is associated with a loss of certain male-specific hepatic characteristics. In this study we investigated the effects of lesser forms of hepatic injury on the levels of estrogen and androgen receptor activity in the liver. Adult male rats were subjected to portacaval shunt, partial portal vein ligation, hepatic artery ligation, or two-thirds partial hepatectomy. Another group of animals was treated with cyclosporine. At the time of sacrifice the livers were removed and used to determine the estrogen and androgen receptor activity in the hepatic cytosol. A significant reduction p less than 0.05 in the hepatic cytosolic androgen receptor activity and a slight increase in the estrogen receptor activity occurred following total portosystemic shunting. Partial ligation of the portal vein, which produces a lesser degree of portosystemic shunting, had no effect on the levels of the estrogen and androgen receptor activity present within hepatic cytosol. Cyclosporine-treated animals had significantly greater p less than 0.01 levels of estrogen receptor activity in the hepatic cytosol compared to vehicle-treated control animals. Levels of estrogen and androgen receptor activity within the hepatic cytosol remained unchanged after ligation of the hepatic artery. The reduction in the cytosolic estrogen and androgen receptor activity in the liver after partial hepatectomy was confirmed. In summary, certain types of hepatic injury are associated with profound changes in the estrogen and androgen receptor content within the liver."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Hypericin HY is a powerful photo-inducer of apoptosis in Jurkat cells as measured by caspase-3 activation, cell shrinkage, phosphatidylserine PS exposure and the appearance of hypoploid DNA. These processes are preceded by rapid Bcl-2-independent mitochondrial transmembrane depolarization and a drop in cytoplasmic pH. Pre-incubation of cells with inhibitors of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, such as cyclosporin A or bongkrekic acid, does not protect cells from mitochondrial membrane potential deltapsim decrease. However, monitoring of mitochondrial entrapped calcein by confocal fluorescence imaging gives clear evidence of HY photo-induced mitochondrial permeability. This should be considered as the result of a non-specific alteration of mitochondrial membrane integrity brought about by lipid peroxidation. Nevertheless, synthesis of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 appears to delay the subsequent time course of PS exposure and to reduce caspase-3 activation and the fraction of cells which become hypoploid. We interpret this partially protective effect as the consequence of a direct interaction of Bcl-2 with cytosolic cytochrome c previously released from mitochondria upon deltapsim decrease and/or of Bcl-2 inhibition of the deleterious retro-effect of caspase-3 on the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and/or the mitochondrial membrane components."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"The induction of cell death in leukemic HL-60 cells by the ether lipid 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine ET-18-OCH3 edelfosine followed the typical apoptotic changes in ultrastructural morphology, including blebbing, chromatin condensation, nuclear membrane breakdown and extensive vacuolation. Using a cytofluorimetric approach, we found that ET-18-OCH3 induced disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential DeltaPsim followed by production of reactive oxygen species ROS and DNA fragmentation in leukemic cells. ET-18-OCH3 also induced caspase-3 activation in human leukemic cells, as assessed by cleavage of caspase-3 into the p17 active form and cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate polyADP-ribose polymerase PARP. ET-18-OCH3 analogues unable to induce apoptosis failed to disrupt DeltaPsim and to activate caspase-3. ET-18-OCH3-resistant Jurkat cells generated from sensitive Jurkat cells showed no caspase-3 activation and did not undergo DeltaPsim disruption upon ET-18-OCH3 incubation. Cyclosporin A partially inhibited DeltaPsim dissipation, caspase activation and apoptosis in ET-18-OCH3-treated leukemic cells. Overexpression of bcl-2 by gene transfer prevented DeltaPsim collapse, ROS generation, caspase activation and apoptosis in ET-18-OCH3-treated leukemic T cells. Pretreatment with the caspase inhibitor Z-Asp-2, 6-dichlorobenzoyloxymethylketone prevented ET-18-OCH3-induced PARP proteolysis and DNA fragmentation, but not DeltaPsim dissipation. ET-18-OCH3 did not affect the expression of caspases and bcl-2-related genes. ET-18-OCH3-induced apoptosis did not require protein synthesis. Our data indicate that DeltaPsim dissipation and caspase-3 activation are critical events of the apoptotic cascade triggered by the antitumor ether lipid ET-18-OCH3, and that the sequence of events in the apoptotic action of ET-18-OCH3 on human leukemic cells is DeltaPsim disruption, caspase-3 activation and internucleosomal DNA degradation."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Amyloid beta-peptide Abeta is widely held to be associated with Alzheimers disease. It was previously demonstrated by our group that Abeta induces cell death by an apoptotic process. We report here that activation of the caspase-3 apoptotic cascade is regulated by calcineurin-mediated BAD dephosphorylation. Calcineurin inhibitors were also proven to be effective by preventing the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential Delta Psim induced by Abeta, not allowing cytochrome c release from mitochondria and subsequently caspase-3 activation. Considering the results presented, we argue that calcineurin activation and BAD dephosphorylation are upstream in premitochondrial signaling events leading to caspase-3 activation in Abeta-peptide-treated cells."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND We have previously shown the long-term influence of renal ischemia/reperfusion I/R injury and immunosuppression on fibrotic genes and apoptosis in a rat model. For the first time, we have now investigated the effects of I/R and immunosuppression on inflammation and caspase activation.   METHODS I/R injury was induced in the right kidney and the left was removed. Cyclosporin CsA 10 mg/kg, tacrolimus 0.2 mg/kg, rapamycin 1 mg/kg, or mycophenolate mofetil MMF 10 mg/kg was then administered for 16 weeks. The effects of I/R and immunosuppressants on interstitial inflammation, interleukin IL-1beta expression, caspase-1 and caspase-3 activation, tubulointerstitial damage, and fibrosis were evaluated.   RESULTS ED-1 a specific rat monocyte/macrophage marker cells were mainly localized in the tubulointerstitium and periglomerular areas and increased in I/R group compared to controls P lt 0.01. This was further increased by CsA, but decreased by tacrolimus, rapamycin, or MMF P lt 0.05. The 17 kD active IL-1beta remained unchanged, but 35 kD IL-1beta precursor was decreased by rapamycin in comparison with I/R group P lt 0.05. The 45 kD or 20 kD caspase-1 was increased by I/R or CsA, respectively, and decreased by rapamycin P lt 0.05. The 24 kD caspase-3, which proved to be an active caspase-3 subunit, was increased in I/R and CsA groups and deceased by tacrolimus, rapamycin, or MMF P lt 0.05, but not 32 kD precursor or 17 kD active caspase-3. The activity data of caspase-1 and caspase-3 exhibited the same trend as Western blotting data. The staining of active caspase-3 was scattered in kidneys, mainly in tubular and interstitial areas, which was consistent with that of ED-1 cells. There was a strong positive correlation between interstitial inflammation and 24 kD caspase-3 expression or caspase-3 activity r = 0.814 or 0.484, all of which were also closely related with urinary protein r = 0.537, 0.529, or 0.517, serum creatinine r = 0.463, 0.573, or 0.539, tubulointerstitial damage r = 0.794, 0.618, or 0.712 and fibrosis r = 0.651, 0.567, or 0.469, all P lt 0.01.   CONCLUSION This study shows that the mechanisms of long-term I/R injury and immunosuppressants treatment include interstitial inflammation and caspase activation, most clearly demonstrated by the 24 kD active caspase-3."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"AP9-cd, a standardized lignan composition from Cedrus deodara consisting of --wikstromal, --matairesinol, and dibenzyl butyrolactol, showed cytotoxicity in several human cancer cell lines reported earlier. An attempt was made in this study to investigate the mechanism of cell death in human leukemia Molt-4 and HL-60 cells. It inhibited Molt-4 cell proliferation with 48-h IC50 of approximately 15 microg/ml, increased sub-G0 cell fraction with no mitotic block, produced apoptotic bodies and induced DNA ladder formation. Flow cytometric analysis of annexinV-FITC/PI-stained cells showed time-related increase in apoptosis and post-apoptotic necrosis. All these biological end-points indicated cell death by apoptosis. Further, initial events involved massive nitric oxide NO formation within 4 h with subsequent late appearance of peroxides in cells measured by flow cytometry using specific fluorescent probes. Persistently high levels of NO and peroxide appeared to decrease mitochondrial membrane potential Psimt which was recovered by cyclosporin A in Molt-4 cells. AP9-cd caused 2-fold activation of caspase-3 in Molt-4 and 5-fold activation in HL-60 cells. Also caspases-8 and -9 were activated in HL-60 cells. Ascorbate suppressed the enhanced caspases activities indicating a pro-oxidant effect of AP9-cd. Further, caspase-3 activation correlated with NO generation that was partially impaired by nitric oxide synthase NOS inhibitors and ascorbate suggesting a role of pro-oxidant species in caspase-3 activation. AP9-cd produced no cytotoxicity in primary rat hepatocyte culture at the concentrations used. The studies indicated that AP9-cd mediated early NO formation leads to caspases activation, peroxide generation, and mitochondrial depolarization which may be responsible for mitochondrial-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways involved in the killing of leukemia cells by AP9-cd."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Sanguinarine, chelerythrine and chelidonine possess prominent apoptotic effects towards cancer cells. In this study, we found that sanguinarine and chelerythrine induce apoptosis in human CEM T-leukemia cells, and that is accompanied by an early increase in cytosolic cytochrome c that precedes caspases-8, -9 and -3 processing. During apoptosis induction by sanguinarine and chelerythrine, reactive oxygen species ROS was rapidly generated and DeltaPsimt dissipated, while Bax, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL/S proteins content in the mitochondrial fraction did not change significantly. Caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation were considerably inhibited by N-acetyl-cysteine NAC. Chelidonine induced only a slight release of cytochrome c 12h, parallel to caspase-3 activation. Effect of sanguinarine or chelerythrine towards mitochondria was confirmed by marked changes in morphology of this organelle 3h, while chelidonine did not affect mitochondria intactness. Sanguinarine or chelerythrine also caused an intensive DNA damage in cells in 1h, however a massive increase in number of such impaired cells occurred in 6h, while chelidonine induced intensive DNA damage in 15-20 cells only in 24h. Thus, our results demonstrated that rapid cytochrome c release in CEM T-leukemia cells exposed to sanguinarine or chelerythrine was not accompanied by changes in Bax, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL/S proteins in the mitochondrial fraction, and preceded activation of the initiator caspase-8."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Aloe-emodin AE, a natural, biologically active compound from the rhizome of Rheum palmatum, has been shown to induce apoptosis in several cancer cell lines in vitro. However, its molecular mechanism of action in the apoptosis induction of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma NPC cells has not been explored. This study shows that AE induced G2/M phase arrest by increasing levels of cyclin B1 bound to Cdc2, and also caused an increase in apoptosis of NPC cells, which was characterized by morphological changes, nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation, cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase PARP and increased sub-G1 population. Treatment of NPC cells with AE also resulted in a decrease in Bcl-XL and an increase in Bax expression. Ectopic expression of Bcl-XL but not Bcl-2 or small interfering RNA siRNA-mediated attenuation of Bax suppressed AE-induced apoptotic cell death. AE-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential MMP and increase in cellular Ca content, reactive oxygen species ROS and apoptotic cell death were suppressed by the treatment of cyclosporin A CsA or caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK. Co-treatment with caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK could inhibit AE-induced cell death and the activation of caspase-3 and -9. In addition, suppression of caspase-8 with the specific inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK inhibited AE-induced the activation of Bax, the cleavage of Bid, the translocation of tBid to the mitochondria and the release of cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor AIF and Endo G from the mitochondria and subsequent apoptosis. Taken together, these results indicate that the caspase-8-mediated activation of the mitochondrial death pathway plays a critical role in AE-induced apoptosis of NPC cells."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Cyclosporine A CsA produces oxidative stress and apoptosis in rat hepatocytes, but it is not known whether membrane lipid peroxidation plays a role in CsA toxicity. The objective of the present study was to determine whether iron-catalyzed hydroxyl or membrane alkoxyl radical formation is causally involved in the prooxidative cell injury and apoptosis. As previously reported, cultured rat hepatocytes exposed to CsA exhibited concentration-dependent signs of apoptotic cell injury, including chromatin condensation and fragmentation, increased caspase-3 activity, and release of cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase. Addition of the ferric iron chelator desferrioxamine or the novel potent lipophilic iron chelator CGP72670 did not protect against CsA-induced cell death, indicating that iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation is unlikely to be involved in CsA-mediated apoptosis. In contrast, the classical chain-breaking lipid peroxidation inhibitor alpha-tocopherol was able to rescue cells from CsA-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis. alpha-Tocopherol not only effectively inhibited the production of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and the formation of reactive oxygen species, but it also prevented proteins from being oxidized and forming mixed disulfides. Furthermore, alpha-tocopherol inhibited the cellular uptake of extracellular calcium 45 Ca 2 into cells, similar to the reducing agent dithiothreitol. By decreasing the extracellular calcium concentrations or by adding calcium channel blockers diltiazem, nifedipine or a cell-permeable calcium chelator Bis-o-aminophenoxy-ethane-N,N,N,N-tertraacetic acid BAPTA, both CsA-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis were inhibited, indicating a pivotal role of Ca 2 in mediating CsA-induced cell injury. These results suggest that alpha-tocopherol protects from CsA-mediated apoptosis and cytotoxictiy by preventing the oxidation of redox-sensitive Ca 2 -ATPase. Thus, it is the attenuation of increased calcium influx and, hence, the inhibition of caspase-3 activation, rather than the downstream inhibition of lipid peroxidation, that is a key mechanism of the protection provided by alpha-tocopherol against CsA-induced cell injury."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"The role of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore MPTP in apoptosis of nucleated cells is well documented. In contrast, the role of MPTP in apoptosis of anucleated platelets is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to elucidate the contribution of MPTP in the control of different manifestations of platelet apoptosis by analyzing the effect of cyclosporin A CsA, a potent inhibitor of MPTP formation. Using flow cytometry, we studied the effect of pretreatment of platelets with CsA on apoptotic responses in human platelets stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187. We found that CsA inhibited A23187-stimulated platelet apoptosis, completely preventing i depolarization of mitochondrial inner membrane potential DeltaPsim, ii activation of cytosolic apoptosis executioner caspase-3, iii platelet shrinkage, and iv fragmentation of platelets to microparticles, but v only partially approximately 25, inhibiting phosphatidylserine PS exposure on the platelet surface. This study shows that MPTP formation is upstream of DeltaPsim depolarization, caspase-3 activation, platelet shrinkage and microparticle formation, and stringently controls these apoptotic events in A23187-stimulated platelets but is less involved in PS externalization. These data also indicate that CsA may rescue platelets from apoptosis, preventing caspase-3 activation and inhibiting the terminal cellular manifestations of platelet apoptosis, such as platelet shrinkage and degradation to microparticles. Furthermore, the results suggest a novel potentially useful application of CsA as an inhibitor of platelet demise through apoptosis in thrombocytopenias associated with enhanced platelet apoptosis."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Parkinsonism is one of the major neurological symptoms in Wilson disease, and young workers who worked in the copper smelting industry also developed Parkinsonism. We have reported the specific neurotoxic action of copper dopamine complex in neurons with dopamine uptake. Copper dopamine complex 100 microm induces cell death in RCSN-3 cells by disrupting the cellular redox state, as demonstrated by a 1.9-fold increase in oxidized glutathione levels and a 56 cell death inhibition in the presence of 500 microm ascorbic acid disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential with a spherical shape and well preserved morphology determined by transmission electron microscopy inhibition 72, p lt 0.001 of phosphatidylserine externalization with 5 microm cyclosporine A lack of caspase-3 activation formation of autophagic vacuoles containing mitochondria after 2 h transfection of cells with green fluorescent protein-light chain 3 plasmid showing that 68 of cells presented autophagosome vacuoles colocalization of positive staining for green fluorescent protein-light chain 3 and Rhod-2AM, a selective indicator of mitochondrial calcium and DNA laddering after 12-h incubation. These results suggest that the copper dopamine complex induces mitochondrial autophagy followed by caspase-3-independent apoptotic cell death. However, a different cell death mechanism was observed when 100 microm copper dopamine complex was incubated in the presence of 100 microm dicoumarol, an inhibitor of NADPH quinoneoxidoreductase EC 1.6.99.2, also known as DT-diaphorase and NQ01, because a more extensive and rapid cell death was observed. In addition, cyclosporine A had no effect on phosphatidylserine externalization, significant portions of compact chromatin were observed within a vacuolated nuclear membrane, DNA laddering was less pronounced, the mitochondria morphology was more affected, and the number of cells with autophagic vacuoles was a near 4-fold less."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Hemorrhagic shock HS is associated with the activation of caspase-dependent or -independent apoptotic signaling pathways, disruption of endothelial cell adherens junctions, and vascular hyperpermeability. Recent studies have suggested that the vascular hyperpermeability observed after HS is associated with activation of the intrinsic apoptotic signaling cascade resulting in caspase-mediated cleavage of endothelial cell adherens proteins and subsequent cell-cell detachment. We hypothesized that cyclosporine A CsA would attenuate vascular hyperpermeability after HS by protecting mitochondrial transition pores and thereby preventing the activation of caspase-mediated apoptotic signaling. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of CsA on, HS-induced hyperpermeability, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, and caspase 3 activation.   METHODS HS was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by withdrawing blood to reduce the mean arterial pressure to 40 mm Hg for 60 minutes. CsA 10 microL/mL was given 10 minutes before the shock period. The mesenteric postcapillary venules of the proximal ileum were monitored for permeability changes using intravital microscopy. The changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential were determined using the cationic dye JC-1. Mitochondrial release of cytochrome c in to the cytosol was detected using ELISA. Caspase-3 activity was measured using a fluorometric assay.   RESULTS HS induced vascular hyperpermeability, release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-3 p lt 0.05. CsA 10 microL/mL attenuated HS-induced hyperpermeability p lt 0.05 and prevented HS-induced decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential. CsA treatment decreased the HS-induced rise in cytosolic cytochrome c levels and caspase-3 activity p lt 0.05.   CONCLUSIONS These findings demonstrate that CsA protects mitochondrial permeability transition pores to prevent HS-induced release of cytochrome c and caspase-3 activation."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"1 Mahanine, a naturally occurring carbazole alkaloid in some Asian vegetables, has been shown to exhibit antimutagenicity, antimicrobial activity, cytotoxicity, and other biological properties. 2 In the present study, we investigated the effect of mahanine on the activation of the apoptotic pathway in human leukemia U937 cells. Various end points were used to screen for apoptosis Morphological changes in cells, the relative numbers of viable and apoptotic cells translocation of membrane bound phosphatidylserine and DNA analysis. 3 We found that mahanine-induced apoptosis in U937 cells involved activation of caspases, including caspase-3, release of cytochrome c into cytosol, loss of mitochondrial membrane permeability, and decreased levels of cellular ATP. 4 Pretreatment of cells with cyclosporine A, prior to/concomitant with exposure to mahanine, effectively prevented the deleterious effects of the alkaloid on cellular integrity and viability. 5 As mitochondrial permeability is known to be important in the regulation of cytochrome c release, our observations indicate that mitochondria are the principal target of mahanine. More specifically, we propose that mahanine causes the mitochondrial membranes to lose their permeability, resulting in caspase-3 activation and apoptosis."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Stress of the endoplasmic reticulum ER, which is associated with many neurodegenerative conditions, can lead to the elimination of affected cells by apoptosis through only partially understood mechanisms. Thapsigargin, which causes ER stress by inhibiting the ER Ca2-ATPase, was found to not only activate the apoptosis effector caspase-3 but also to cause a large and prolonged increase in the activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta GSK3beta. Activation of GSK3beta was obligatory for thapsigargin-induced activation of caspase-3, because inhibition of GSK3beta by expression of dominant-negative GSK3beta or by the GSK3beta inhibitor lithium blocked caspase-3 activation. Thapsigargin treatment activated GSK3beta by inducing dephosphorylation of phospho-Ser-9 of GSK3beta, a phosphorylation that normally maintains GSK3beta inactivated. Caspase-3 activation induced by thapsigargin was blocked by increasing the phosphorylation of Ser-9-GSK3beta with insulin-like growth factor-1 or with the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A, but the calcineurin inhibitors FK506 and cyclosporin A were ineffective. Insulin-like growth factor-1, okadaic acid, calyculin A, and lithium also protected cells from two other inducers of ER stress, tunicamycin and brefeldin A. Thus, ER stress activates GSK3beta through dephosphorylation of phospho-Ser-9, a prerequisite for caspase-3 activation, and this process is amenable to pharmacological intervention."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"There is increasing evidence that food-derived polyphenols have a beneficial effect for cancers. Our purpose was to determine the effect and mechanism of action of these compounds on pancreatic cancer. We measured effects of quercetin on pancreatic cancer in a nude mouse model. We also investigated the effects of quercetin, rutin, trans-resveratrol and genistein on apoptosis and underlying signaling in pancreatic carcinoma cells in vitro. Quercetin decreased primary tumor growth, increased apoptosis and prevented metastasis in a model of pancreatic cancer. In vitro quercetin and trans-resveratrol, but not rutin, markedly enhanced apoptosis, causing mitochondrial depolarization and cytochrome c release followed by caspase-3 activation. In addition, the effect of a combination of quercetin and trans-resveratrol on mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activity was greater than the expected additive response. The inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition prevented cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation and apoptosis caused by polyphenols. Nuclear factor-kappa B activity was inhibited by quercetin and trans-resveratrol, but not genistein, indicating that this transcription factor is not the only mediator of the polyphenols effects on apoptosis. The results suggest that food-derived polyphenols inhibit pancreatic cancer growth and prevent metastasis by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in cytochrome c release, caspase activation and apoptosis."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"In this research, we investigated the cytotoxic mechanisms of Cochlodinium polykrikoidescell lysate on isolated rat liver hepatocytes.This micro algae is responsible for a severe and widespread harmful algal bloom in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman 2008-2009. Isolated hepatocytes were obtained by collagenase perfusion of Sprague-Dawley rat liver.According to our results, incubation of algal lysate with isolated rat hepatocytescaused hepatocyte membrane lysis, reactive oxygen species ROS formation, glutathione depletion, collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential,ATP depletion and increase in ADP/ATP ratio, cytochrome c release in to the hepatocyte cytosol,activation of caspase-3 final mediator of apoptosis and appearance of apoptosis phenotype. On the other hand, pre-treatment of antioxidants -tocopherol succinate and BHT, radical scavengers mannitol and DMSO, mitochondrial permeability transition MPT pore sealing agents cyclosporine A, carnitine and trifluoperazine, NADPH P450 reductase inhibitor Diphenyliodonium chloride, CYP2E1 inhibitors Phenylimidazole and 4-Methylpyrazole and ATP generators L-glutamine, Fructose and Xylitolinhibitedcaspase-3 activation and cell death in algal lysate treated hepatocytes.Our data also confirmed that algal lysate activates apoptosis signaling via oxidative stress and mitochondrial pathway. Thus, ROS formation caused by the lysate exposure could directly be involved in mitochondrial MPT pore opening and activation of caspase-3 leading to C.polykrikoides lysateinduced apoptosis on rat hepatocytes. These findings contribute to a better understanding of C.polykrikoides-toxic effects on mammalian liver cells."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Cordyceps sorbolifera has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for improving the renal function. Cyclosporine A CsA is an important immunosuppressive agent in the prevention of renal allograft rejection, but long-term usage of CsA could lead to chronic nephrotoxicity and renal graft failure. The study was aimed to investigate whether the mycelia glycoproteins of Cordyceps sobolifera CSP exert prevention effects on CsA-induced nephrotoxicity.   MATERIALS AND METHODS Sprague-Dawley SD rats were randomly assigned into four groups n=6 per group normal saline control group, CSP group, CsA group, and CSP-CsA group CsA combined treatment with CSP. Glomerular and tubular functions were assessed and histological studies were performed.   RESULTS CSP, prepared by hot water extraction, ethanol precipitation and membrane dialysis, was found to be composed of three glycoproteins with average molecular weights of 543, 31, and 6.3 kDa, respectively. CsA impaired urea clearance and creatinine clearance were significantly improved by concomitant administration of CSP. TUNEL histochemical stain revealed that CSP significantly decreased CsA-induced apoptosis in renal tubular cells. The reducing effect of caspase-3 activation by CSP was suggested through the over-expression of the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 in renal tubule cells. In assessment of CSP protection of renal tubule function, we found that CSP restored CsA induced magnesium wasting by increasing the magnesium reabsorption channels TRMP6 and TRMP7.   CONCLUSION The results suggested that CSP had a significant suppressive activity on CsA-induced apoptosis and protective activity against nephron loss possibly via its restoring activity by increasing the magnesium reabsorption channels TRMP6 and TRMP7 on CsA induced magnesium wasting."
Cyclosporin A,COX-2 inhibition,"AIMS The hypertensive effect of the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine CSA is paralleled, and probably triggered, by impaired arterial baroreceptor sensitivity BRS. Here we asked if these effects of CSA are influenced by co-administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs and if the oxidative NADPH-oxidase NADPHox/Rho-kinase ROCK pathway mediates this interaction.   MATERIALS AND METHODS Female rats were treated for 10days with CSA 25mg/kg/day, diclofenac DIC, COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor, 1mg/kg/day, celecoxib COX-2 inhibitor, 10mg/kg/day, or their combinations. Baroreflex curves relating changes in heart rate HR to increases or decreases in blood pressure BP evoked by phenylephrine PE and sodium nitroprusside SNP, respectively, were constructed and slopes of the curves were taken as measures of BRS.   KEY FINDINGS Compared with control rats, CSA increased BP and reduced reflex chronotropic responses as indicated by the significantly smaller BRSPE and BRSSNP values. Similar effects were observed in rats treated with diclofenac alone or combined with CSA. Whereas CSA hypertension was maintained after selective COX-2 inhibition by celecoxib, the concomitant BRS reductions were largely eliminated. NADPHox inhibition by diphenyleneiodonium DPI blunted the CSA/DIC-evoked increases and decreases in BP and BRSPE, respectively. By contrast, fasudil ROCK inhibitor had no effect on CSA/DIC hypertension but reversed the associated reductions in both BRSPE and BRSSNP.   SIGNIFICANCE Depending on the nature of the cardiovascular response, NADPHox and ROCK contribute variably to the worsened cardiovascular profile in CSA/DIC-treated rats. Further, celecoxib rather than diclofenac could be a better choice as an add-on therapy to CSA in autoimmune arthritic conditions."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"With the purpose to explore the mechanisms associated with the intestinal toxicity of Ochratoxin A OTA, an intestinal porcine epithelial cell line IPEC-J2 was applied in this study as in vitro models for intestinal epithelium. The results confirmed that OTA induced IPEC-J2 cell toxicity by MTT assay and apoptosis by Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometer analysis. We also observed that OTA induced the mitochondrial reactive oxygen species ROS production and mitochondrial permeability transition pore mPTP opening by confocal microscopy. Western blot showed that OTA induced cytochrome c cyt-c release and caspase-3 activation, which could be suppressed by inhibition of mPTP opening with cyclosporin A. Treatment with Mito-TEMPO, the mitochondria-targeted ROS scavenger, blocked OTA-induced mitochondrial ROS generation and mPTP opening and prevented cyt-c release, caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis in IPEC-J2 cells."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"The mitochondrial permeability transition pore mPTP is a complex channel of the inner membrane, the opening of which leads to mitochondrial swelling and dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential MMP. Here, we aimed to evaluate the role of the cyclophilin D CypD as a prominent mediator of mPTP, on necroptosis and autophagy as well as apoptosis, beyond the global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion I/R injury. We showed that while cerebral I/R injury is accompanied by loss of MMP, mitochondrial swelling and programmed cell death, pretreatment with cyclosporine-A CsA as a potent inhibitor of CypD, led to partial but significant reduction in necroptosis markers, RIP1 and RIP3 as well as activity of glutamate-ammonia ligase GLUL and glutamate dehydrogenase 1 GLUD1, downstream enzymes of RIP3. Administration of CsA also partially decreased autophagy associated proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Bax/Bcl-2 ratio as well as caspase-3 activation, as the executioner of apoptosis, noticeably decreased by CsA pretreatment. Taken together, our results suggest that the CypD alongside the apoptosis regulation plays a partial role in inducing necroptosis and autophagy."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"We designed this study to investigate whether cadmium induces caspase-independent apoptosis and to investigate the relationship between the caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptotic pathways. Cadmium 1.25-2.5 M induced oxidative stress in rat proximal tubular rPT cells, as seen in the reactive oxygen species levels N-acetylcysteine prevented this. Cyclosporin A CsA prevented mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening and apoptosis there was mitochondrial ultrastructural disruption, mitochondrial cytochrome c cyt c translocation to the cytoplasm, and subsequent caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation. Z-VAD-FMK prevented caspase-3 activation and apoptosis and decreased BNIP-3 Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein 3 expression levels and apoptosis-inducing factor/endonuclease G AIF/Endo G translocation. Simultaneously, cadmium induced prominent BNIP-3 expression in the mitochondria and cytoplasmic AIF/Endo G translocation to the nucleus. BNIP-3 silencing significantly prevented AIF and Endo G translocation and decreased the apoptosis rate, cyt c release, and caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation. These results suggest that BNIP-3 is involved in the caspase-independent apoptotic pathway and is located upstream of AIF/Endo G both the caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways are involved in cadmium-induced rPT cell apoptosis and act synergistically."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Myocardial apoptosis is a significant problem underlying ischemic heart disease. We previously reported significantly elevated expression of cytoplasmic Omi/HtrA2, triggers cardiomyocytes apoptosis. However, whether increased Omi/HtrA2 within mitochondria itself influences myocardial survival in vivo is unknown. We aim to observe the effects of mitochondria-specific, not cytoplasmic, Omi/HtrA2 on myocardial apoptosis and cardiac function. Transgenic mice overexpressing cardiac-specific mitochondrial Omi/HtrA2 were generated and they had increased myocardial apoptosis, decreased systolic and diastolic function, and decreased left ventricular remodeling. Transiently or stably overexpression of mitochondria Omi/HtrA2 in H9C2 cells enhance apoptosis as evidenced by elevated caspase-3, -9 activity and TUNEL staining, which was completely blocked by Ucf-101, a specific Omi/HtrA2 inhibitor. Mechanistic studies revealed mitochondrial Omi/HtrA2 overexpression degraded the mitochondrial anti-apoptotic protein HAX-1, an effect attenuated by Ucf-101. Additionally, transfected cells overexpressing mitochondrial Omi/HtrA2 were more sensitive to hypoxia and reoxygenation H/R induced apoptosis. Cyclosporine A CsA, a mitochondrial permeability transition inhibitor, blocked translocation of Omi/HtrA2 from mitochondrial to cytoplasm, and protected transfected cells incompletely against H/R-induced caspase-3 activation. We report in vitro and in vivo overexpression of mitochondrial Omi/HtrA2 induces cardiac apoptosis and dysfunction. Thus, strategies to directly inhibit Omi/HtrA2 or its cytosolic translocation from mitochondria may protect against heart injury."
Cyclosporin A,COX-2 inhibition,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs and the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine CSA are concurrently administered in arthritis. Here, we investigated whether diclofenac non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-1 and 2, COX-1/COX-2, celecoxib selective COX-2 inhibitor or SC560 selective COX-1 inhibitor interact variably with haemodynamic effects of CSA in conscious female rats. Changes caused by CSA 10 mg/kg i.v. in blood pressure BP, heart rate HR, HR variability HRV and myocardial contractility were assessed in the absence and presence of individual NSAIDs 10 mg/kg each. Compared with vehicle values, CSA caused immediate and sustained i increases in BP and decreases in pulse pressure index PPI and HR, ii elevations in left ventricular LV contractility dP/dtmax and isovolumic relaxation constant au and iii increases in the time- and frequency-domain indices of HRV and shifted the cardiac sympathovagal balance towards parasympathetic dominance. CSA hypertension was abolished in rats pre-treated with celecoxib and intensified in the presence of diclofenac or SC560. Alternatively, the CSA-evoked decreases in PPI, increases in HRV indices and cardiac parasympathetic dominance were blunted by celecoxib in contrast to no effect for diclofenac or SC560. Similarly, celecoxib, but not other NSAIDs, eliminated the elevated LV contractility dP/dtmax and isovolumic relaxation constant au, , which reflect cardiac systolic and diastolic function, respectively, that accompanied the CSA-induced pressure load. The data underscore the preferential capacity of selective COX-2 inhibition by celecoxib to mitigate CSA hypertension and consequent alterations in cardiac performance and autonomic balance. By contrast, CSA effects are preserved or even exacerbated after COX-1 inhibition."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"The exact role of superoxide radicals O2- in apoptosis is still a matter of debate. The main objective of the present study is to evaluate the apoptotic signalling pathway initiated by O2-. The reductive reaction of sodium selenite with glutathione was used as the intracellular O2--generating system. When cells were exposed to 5 to 25 microM selenite, a temporal pattern of apoptotic events was observed following the elevation of O2-, in which cytochrome c release and mitochondrial depolarization preceded caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. The simultaneous treatment with N-acetylcysteine and 4-hydroxy-2,2,6, 6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl markedly reduced O2- level and suppressed the mitochondrial changes and the downstream apoptotic events. Moreover, pretreatment with cyclosporin A plus trifluoperazine, two mitochondrial permeability transition MPT inhibitors, was capable of attenuating O2--mediated cytochrome c release and mitochondrial depolarization, and subsequently inhibiting apoptosis. Thus, the present results provide convincing evidence that O2- generated from the reductive reaction of selenite with GSH is capable of triggering a mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway. Such knowledge may not only help to obtain a better understanding of the apoptotic effect of selenite per se, but of the role of O2- in initiation and execution of apoptosis."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"The cardiotoxicity of cyclosporine A CsA limits its clinical application in extensive and long-term therapies. Our group has shown that CsA induces myocardium cell apoptosis in vivo and increases calcium-sensing receptor CaSR expression. However, its molecular mechanism remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether CaSR plays an essential role in CsA-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells and to investigate the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK signaling cascade in this process. H9c2 cells were treated with CsA in a dose-dependent manner, and decreased Bcl-2 expression, increased Bax expression, and caspase-3 activation were observed. In a time-dependent manner, CsA increased CaSR expression, activated the extracellularly regulated kinase ERK and p38 MAPK pathways, and inactivated the c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK MAPK signaling pathway. When H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells pretreated with gadolinium chloride GdCl3, a CaSR activator, were treated with CsA, decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2, increased phosphorylation of p38, decreased Bcl-2 expression, increased Bax expression, and activated caspase-3 were observed. Cells pretreated with the CaSR inhibitor NPS2390 inhibited this process. Furthermore, the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 markedly blocked the effect of CsA on cell apoptosis, apoptotic-related protein expression, and caspase-3 activation. These findings showed that CsA induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells in vitro, and CaSR mediated the degradation of ERK MAPK and the upregulation of the p38 MAPK pathway involved in CsA-induced H9c2 cardiomyoblast cell apoptosis."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND The inhalation anesthetic isoflurane has been shown to open the mitochondrial permeability transition pore mPTP and induce caspase activation and apoptosis, which may lead to learning and memory impairment. Cyclosporine A, a blocker of mPTP opening might attenuate the isoflurane-induced mPTP opening, lessening its ripple effects. Magnesium and anesthetic propofol are also mPTP blockers. We therefore set out to determine whether propofol and magnesium can attenuate the isoflurane-induced caspase activation and mPTP opening.   METHODS We investigated the effects of magnesium sulfate Mg2, propofol, and isoflurane on the opening of mPTP and caspase activation in H4 human neuroglioma cells stably transfected to express full-length human amyloid precursor protein APP H4 APP cells and in six day-old wild-type mice, employing Western blot analysis and flowcytometry.   RESULTS Here we show that Mg2 and propofol attenuated the isoflurane-induced caspase-3 activation in H4-APP cells and mouse brain tissue. Moreover, Mg2 and propofol, the blockers of mPTP opening, mitigated the isoflurane-induced mPTP opening in the H4-APP cells.   CONCLUSION These data illustrate that Mg2 and propofol may ameliorate the isoflurane-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting its mitochondrial dysfunction. Pending further studies, these findings may suggest the use of Mg2 and propofol in preventing and treating anesthesia neurotoxicity."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"We determined the effects of co-exposure of OTA and other potentially nephrotoxic substances on renal tubule cells IHKE, from the proximal tubule MDCK-C7 cells, representing principal cells of the collecting duct by measuring the activation of caspase-3, an enzyme with key roles in the process of programmed cell death or apoptosis.Substances used in combination with OTA included cadmium, a known nephrotoxin with apoptotic effects, cisplatin anticancer drug, also a known nephrotoxin, cyclosporin A an immunosuppresive agent, H2O2 generated during oxidative cell stress, amphotericin B antifungal agent, and fumonisin B1. Because of the great number of possible combinations, a method based on the 96-well format was developed which allowed a fast and cost-efficient succesive measurement of caspase-3 activity and protein content in one well as well as necrotic effects in parallel.We found that cells responded differently to the various combinations for example, 1 M OTA combined with 100 M cisplatin had an antagonizing effect on caspase-3 activation in IHKE cells but potentiating effects in MDCK-C7. DNA ladder formation confirmed the results. Necrotic effects were very small and additive. We conclude that the co-exposure of renal cells to OTA with other substances can enhance or reduce the apoptotic potential of one substance alone depending on the substance and on the cell line investigated. A ""harmless"" substance can thus convert to a potent cell toxic substance when combined with OTA or other mycotoxins.These first findings show the necessity to further investigate the combined effects of OTA or other mycotoxins with other substances or of mycotoxins with each other."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process for bulk degradation of cytoplasmic components, including large molecules and organelles. It can either help to enhance or to resist apoptosis, depending on the circumstances. The mechanism of how autophagy impacts apoptosis and the subsequent cellular events upon heat shock remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that mitochondrial membrane permeability transition MPT-sensitive mitochondrial autophagy can protect against heat-induced apoptosis through reduction of cytosolic cytochrome c release and downstream caspase-3 activation. With confocal microscopy, it was revealed that as autophagosomes increased, mitochondrial content was mass decreased after heat shock. Detailed analysis shows that a single swelling mitochondrion could be entrapped into autophagosome. The depolarization of mitochondria preceded the mitochondrial loss, and both could be abolished by MPT inhibitor cyclosporine CsA. In addition, along with the decrease of mitochondrial content, the level of total cytochrome c was also reduced, resulting in a reduction of its release to cytoplasm. When heat shock was combined with 3-methyladenine 3-MA, an inhibitor of autophagy, the mitochondrial loss and the reduction of total cytochrome c were both inhibited, and then caspase-3 activation and cell apoptosis were increased. Thus, it is reasonable to believe that, heat shock-induced cellular events can be modulated by controlling autophagy, and this may represent a novel approach to enhance the efficacy of hyperthermia."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"RutheniumIII complexes are increasingly attracting the interest of researchers due to their promising pharmacological properties. In the present study, we investigated the ability of cis-dichlorotetramminerutheniumIII chloride to produce lethal effects in human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells. The MTT tetrazolium reduction test and the trypan blue exclusion assay revealed that the IC50 for the compound after 48 h of incubation with K562 cells was approximately 10.74 and 73.45 microM, respectively. Interestingly, it was observed that this compound exhibits mild cytotoxicity towards MRC-5 human fibroblast cells IC50gt383 microM. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that cis-dichlorotetramminerutheniumIII chloride was capable of change cell cycle distribution since the percentage of cells in the G1, S and G2 phases decreased. In addition, treatment with this compound induced apoptotic cell death in K562 cells, demonstrated by increased DNA content in the sub-G1-peak and a significant increase in caspase-3 activity. Assay using cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore MPT showed that the preincubation of K562 cells with this inhibitor had not effect on cis-dichlorotetramminerutheniumIII chloride induced caspase-3 activation. In summary, cis-dichlorotetramminerutheniumIII chloride displayed a significant cytotoxic effect through cell cycle arrest and apoptotic induction in K562 cells, which suggests that cis-dichlorotetramminerutheniumIII chloride might have therapeutic potential against leukemia."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"The killing of L929 mouse fibroblasts by tumor necrosis factor-alpha TNF-alpha in the presence of 0.5 microg/ml actinomycin D Act D is prevented by inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition MPT with cyclosporin A CyA in combination with the phospholipase A2 inhibitor aristolochic acid ArA. The MPT is accompanied by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation in the cytosol, cleavage of the nuclear enzyme polyADP-ribosepolymerase PARP, and DNA fragmentation, all of which were inhibited by CyA plus ArA. The caspase-3 inhibitor z-Asp-Glu-Val-aspartic acid fluoromethyl-ketone Z-DEVD-FMK did not prevent the loss of viability or the redistribution of cytochrome c, but it did prevent caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, and DNA fragmentation. Inhibition of the MPT reduced the activation of caspase-8 to the level occurring with TNF-alpha alone no ActD. The caspase-8 inhibitor z-Ile-GluOMe-Thr-AspOMe fluoromethylketone Z-IETD-FMK did not prevent the cell killing and decreased only slightly the translocation of Bid to the mitochondria. These data indicate that induction of the MTP by TNF-alpha causes a release of cytochrome c, caspase-3 activation with PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation. The loss of viability is dependent on the MPT but independent of the activation of caspase-3. The activation of caspase-8 is not dependent on the MPT. There is no evidence linking this enzyme to the loss of viability. Thus, the killing of L929 fibroblasts by TNF-alpha can occur in the absence of either caspase-3 or caspase-8 activity. Alternatively, cell death can be prevented despite an activation of caspase-8."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Organophosphorus OP compounds have been shown to be cytotoxic to SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell cultures. The mechanisms involved in OP compound-induced cell death apoptosis versus necrosis were assessed morphologically by looking at nuclear fragmentation and budding using the fluorescent stain Hoechst 33342 10 microgram/ml. Hoechst staining revealed significant paraoxon 1 mM, parathion 1 mM, phenyl saligenin phosphate PSP, 10 and 100 microM, tri-ortho-tolyl phosphate TOTP, 100 microM and 1 mM, and triphenyl phosphite TPPi, 1 mM induced time-dependent increases in traditional apoptosis p lt 0.05. In many cells, PSP and TOTP 1 mM also induced nuclear condensation with little fragmentation or budding. Pretreatment with cyclosporin A 500 nM, 30 h decreased apoptosis following 1 mM parathion and TOTP exposures. Apoptotic nuclear changes were verified by DNA gel electrophoresis. Activation of caspase-3, a cysteine aspartate protease, was also monitored. OP compounds induced significant time-dependent increases in caspase-3 activation following paraoxon 1 mM, parathion 100 microM, 1 mM, PSP 10 microM, 100 microM, 1 mM, TOTP 100 microM, 1 mM, and TPPi 1 mM exposure p lt 0.05. Pretreatment with cyclosporin A 500 nM, 30 h significantly decreased caspase-3 activation during extended incubations with paraoxon, parathion, and TPPi p lt 0.05. In addition, pretreatment with the caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO and the caspase-8 inhibitor Ac-IETD-CHO 25 microM, 8 h significantly decreased caspase-3 activation following exposure to 1 mM PSP and parathion p lt 0.05. Pretreatment with the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride PMSF 1 mM, 8 h also significantly decreased caspase activation following 1 mM PSP and TOTP exposures p lt 0.05. Alteration of OP compound-induced nuclear fragmentation or caspase-3 activation by pretreatment with cyclosporin A, Ac-IETD-CHO, or PMSF suggested that OP compound-induced cytotoxicity may be modulated through multiple sites, including mitochondrial permeability pores, receptor-mediated caspase pathways, or serine proteases."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Quinacrine QU, a phospholipase-A2 PLA-2 inhibitor has been used clinically as a chemotherapeutic adjuvant. To understand the mechanisms leading to its chemotherapeutic effect, we have investigated QU-induced apoptotic signaling pathways in human cervical squamous carcinoma HeLa cells. In this study, we found that QU induced cytochrome c-dependent apoptotic signaling. The release of pro-apoptotic cytochrome c was QU concentration- and time-dependent, and preceded activation of caspase-9 and -3. Flow cytometric FACScan analysis using fluorescence intensities of DiOC6 demonstrated that QU-induced cytochrome c release was independent of mitochondrial permeability transition MPT, since the concentrations of QU that induced cytochrome c release did not alter mitochondrial membrane potential delta paim. Moreover, kinetic analysis of caspase activities showed that cytochrome c release led to the activation of caspase-9 and downstream death effector, caspase-3. Caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO partially blocked QU-induced apoptosis, suggesting the importance of caspase-3 in this apoptotic signaling mechanism. Supplementation with arachidonic acid AA sustained caspase-3 activation induced by QU. Using inhibitors against cellular arachidonate metabolism of lipooxygenase Nordihydroxyguaiaretic Acid, NDGA and cyclooxygenase 5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraynoic Acid, ETYA demonstrated that QU-induced apoptotic signaling may be dependent on its role as a PLA-2 inhibitor. Interestingly, NDGA attenuated QU-induced cytochrome c release, caspase activity as well as apoptotic cell death. The blockade of cytochrome c release by NDGA was much more effective than that attained with cyclosporin A CsA, a MPT inhibitor. ETYA was not effective in blocking cytochrome c release, except under very high concentrations. Caspase inhibitor z-VAD blocked the release of cytochrome c suggesting that this signaling event is caspase dependent, and caspase-8 activation may be upstream of the mitochondrial events. In summary, we report that QU induced cytochrome c-dependent apoptotic signaling cascade, which may be dependent on its role as a PLA-2 inhibitor. This apoptotic mechanism induced by QU may contribute to its known chemotherapeutic effects."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"The endoplasmic reticulum chaperone glucose-regulated protein 78 GRP78 is selectively expressed on the surface of cancer cells, and contributes to the survival of cancer cells by forming complexes with p85 and promoting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B PI3K-AKT signaling. Herein we report that 2-fluoro-6,7-methylenedioxy-2-phenyl-4-quinolone CHM-1 induces apoptosis of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma NPC cells, as characterized by morphological changes, DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation, and cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase. Using cell surface biotinylation, flow cytometric analysis, co-immunoprecipitation, and ectopic expression of GRP78, we demonstrated that the attenuation of the cell surface localization and complex formation with p85 of GRP78 by CHM-1 was involved in the inhibition of PI3K-AKT signaling and the induction of apoptosis. CHM-1 treatment induced phosphorylation on Thr 69 of B cell lymphoma 2 and inhibited phosphorylation of Ser 136 on Bcl-2-associated death promoter, that were reversed by overexpression of GRP78. We further observed that loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and increase in reactive oxygen species content, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, caspase-9 activation, and apoptotic cell death induced by CHM-1, were suppressed by treatment with cyclosporine A, and by the overexpression of constitutively active AKT1 or GRP78. These results indicate that CHM-1 induces NPC cell apoptosis by suppressing the formation of the cell surface-associated GRP78-PI3K-AKT signaling complex, likely through inhibition of the formation of cell surface-associated GRP78-p85 complexes."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"The abundance of dead macrophages in close proximity to HOCl-modified proteins in advanced atherosclerotic plaques implicates HOCl in the killing of macrophages and the formation of the necrotic core region. The mechanism of HOCl mediated death of macrophages was unknown, so using human monocyte derived macrophages HMDM we here have shown that HOCl causes a rapid necrotic cell death characterized by loss of MTT reduction, cellular ATP and cell lysis without caspase-3 activation in HMDM cells. The HOCl causes a rise in cytosolic calcium level via the plasma membrane L- and T-type calcium channels and endoplasmic reticulum RyR channel. Blocking of the calcium channels or the addition of calpain inhibitors prevents the HOCl mediated loss of mitochondrial potential, lysosome failure and HMDM cell death. Blocking MPT-pore formation with cyclosporin A also prevents the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosomal destabilization and HMDM cell death. Blocking the calcium mitochondrial uniporter with ruthenium red also blocks the loss of mitochondrial potential but only at high concentrations. HOCl appears to cause HMDM cell death through destabilization of cytosolic calcium control resulting in the failure of both the mitochondria and lysosomes."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Aberrant processing of amyloid- protein precursor APP into amyloid- A fragments underlies the formation of senile plaques in Alzheimers disease AD. Moreover, A fragments, particularly A42, exert direct toxic effects within neurons including the induction of mitochondrial oxidative stress MOS. Interestingly, individuals with Down syndrome DS frequently develop early onset AD as a major co-morbid phenotype. One hypothesis for AD associated with DS involves the overexpression of wild type WT APP protein, due to its location on chromosome 21. However, the mechanism by which the overexpression of WT APP might trigger MOS and induce cell death is presently unclear. Here we show that transient overexpression of DsRed2-tagged APP WT in CHO cells induces caspase-3 activation and nuclear fragmentation indicative of apoptosis. APP localizes to the mitochondrial fraction of transfected CHO cells and induces glutathione-sensitive opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore mPTP and cytochrome c release. MOS and intrinsic apoptosis induced by APP are significantly inhibited by co-expression of Bcl-2 or treatment with either glutathione or a pan-caspase inhibitor. The mPTP inhibitor, cyclosporin A, also significantly attenuates APP-induced apoptosis. APP-induced apoptosis is unaffected by a -secretase inhibitor and is independent of detectable A42 however, a -secretase inhibitor significantly protects against APP overexpression, suggesting a possible role of the APP intracellular domain in cell death. These data indicate that overexpression of WT APP is sufficient to induce MOS and intrinsic apoptosis, suggesting a novel pro-oxidant role for APP at mitochondria which may be relevant in AD and DS disease pathologies."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"The cellular and molecular mechanisms of cold storage-ATN are not well characterized. In our earlier studies, cold storage caused necrosis of human proximal tubular epithelial RPTE cells, whereas apoptosis was prominent during rewarming. An intriguing finding was the pronounced swelling of the mitochondria in the cold, which promoted us to further characterize its role in rewarming-associated apoptosis. Human proximal tubular epithelial cells were cold stored in University of Wisconsin UW solution for 48 h followed by 24 h of rewarming in regular cell culture medium. During the cold storage, there was no significant change in the Bcl-2 to Bax protein ratio, mitochondrial location of cytochrome C or caspse-3 activity. However, during rewarming, the Bcl-2 to Bax ratio increased, cytochrome C was translocated to cytosol, and caspase-3 was activated events and timing were consistent with the occurrence of apoptosis during rewarming. In a time-course experiment, mitochondrial swelling was discernable by electron microscopy as early as at 2 h. Cold storage of isolated-mitochondria for 2 h was attended by an increase in the opening of the permeability transition pores PTP, suggesting PTP opening as an early mechanism for mitochondrial swelling. Addition of antioxidants deferoxamine or 2-methyaminochroman to the storage solution suppressed mitochondrial pore opening and swelling, Bcl-2 to Bax ratio increase, cytochrome C translocation, caspase-3 activation as well as rewarming-induced apoptosis. Our data demonstrate for the first time that apoptosis following cold storage and rewarming of human renal tubular cells is accompanied by specific mitochondrial events, and that these events and apoptosis can be suppressed by adding antioxidants to the cold storage solution."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"We previously reported synergistic induction of apoptosis by IFN-gamma plus either cyclosporin A CsA or tacrolimus FK506 in gastric carcinoma cells. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism for this synergistic induction of apoptosis. IFN-gamma plus CsA synergistically induced caspase-3 mediated apoptosis in gastric carcinoma cells. Although IFN-gamma induced activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription1 STAT1 and expression of interferon regulatory factor-1 IRF-1 mRNA, IFN-gamma alone was not able to induce caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. When gastric carcinoma cells were treated with cyclohexamide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, following IFN-gamma pretreatment, caspase-3 was activated, and apoptosis was markedly induced. These findings suggest the existence of IFN-gamma-induced anti-apoptotic pathway and we evaluated the effect of IFN-gamma and CsA on calcium-sensitive nuclear factor-kappa B NF-kappa B activation. IFN-gamma increased intracellular calcium ion concentration Ca2i consisting of a spike and a sustained phase, and the latter was completely abrogated by CsA. Activation of NF-kappa B occurred in response to IFN-gamma, and which was markedly inhibited by either CsA or FK506. NF-kappa B decoy also enhanced the cytotoxic effect of IFN-gamma. These results suggest that IFN-gamma may simultaneously induce the STAT1-mediated apoptotic pathway and the anti-apoptotic pathway through calcium-activated NF-kappa B and that inhibition of the latter by CsA may result in dominance of the apoptosis-inducing pathway."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Activated hepatic stellate cells HSCs play a central role in liver fibrogenesis, and apoptosis of activated HSCs might be essential to clear HSCs from injured liver. Gliotoxin induces apoptosis of activated human and rat HSCs by an unknown mechanism.   AIM This study investigated the role of reactive oxygen species ROS and membrane permeability transition MPT in gliotoxin-induced apoptosis of activated human HSCs.   METHODS Primary and immortalized human HSCs were analyzed using confocal microscopy for ROS with dichlorodihdrofluorescence diacetate DCFH-DA fluorophore and for the mitochondrial membrane potential MMP using tetramethylrhodamine methylester TMRM.   RESULTS Gliotoxin at higher concentrations gt or =7.5 microM markedly increased ROS formation, and ROS production was also evident at concentrations of gliotoxin causing necrotic cell death gt or =32.5 microM. Gliotoxin rapidly begins about 20 min at 1.5 microM and 10 min at 7.5 microM disrupts MMP at a concentration as low as 300nM. MMP disruption was followed by cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation. The MPT inhibitors, cyclosporine A 5 microM plus trifluoperazine 12.5 microM, blocked depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane and release of cytochrome c, but did not block apoptosis in HSCs.   CONCLUSIONS Gliotoxin 0.3-7.5 microM induces apoptosis of activated human HSCs with induction of MPT, cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation, whereas at higher doses gt32.5 microM, it induces necrosis. However, gliotoxin also activates a mitochondrial independent pathway."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"The mechanisms underlying the apoptotic activity of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine A and its O-hydroxyethyl-D-Ser8-derivative SDZ IMM125 in rat hepatocytes are not yet fully understood. It was the purpose of the present study to investigate the role of anti- and pro-oxidants and of caspase-3 and intracellular Ca2 in SDZ IMM125-induced apoptosis in rat hepatocytes. SDZ IMM125 induced an increase in chromatin condensation and fragmentation, and the activation of caspase-3. Supplementing the cell cultures with the antioxidants, D,L-alpha-tocopherol-polyethylene-glycol-1000-succinate, ascorbic acid, and the reducing agent, dithiothreitol, significantly inhibited the SDZ IMM125-mediated increase in chromatin condensation and fragmentation, and caspase-3 activity. D,L-alpha-tocopherol-polyethylene-glycol-1000-succinate and dithiothreitol caused significant inhibition on SDZ IMM125-mediated cellular Ca2 uptake. The glutathione synthetase inhibitor, buthionine sulfoximine, increased SDZ IMM125-mediated caspase-3 action in parallel to chromatin condensation and fragmentation as well as Ca2 influx. Supplementation the culture medium with the intracellular Ca2 chelator bis-o-aminophenoxy-ethane-N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid as well as omission of calcium in the medium reduced SDZ IMM125-induced apoptosis whereas the calcium supplementation of the culture medium elevated SDZ IMM125-induced apoptosis. Calcium antagonists inhibited SDZ IMM125-induced caspase-3 activation. Our data indicate that SDZ IMM125-mediated apoptosis in rat hepatocytes can be inhibited by antioxidants, and that the intracellular redox-state can act as a modulator of cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Further, the results suggest that SDZ IMM125-induced uptake of extracellular calcium is also a redox-sensitive process and that the increased intracellular calcium might directly cause apoptosis by increasing the caspase-3 activity as a central event in the cyclosporine-induced apoptotic mechanism."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND amp AIMS Ischemia/reperfusion can initiate both necrotic and apoptotic death of hepatocytes. Previous work showed that onset of the mitochondrial permeability transition MPT can initiate necrotic cell death after reperfusion, but the MPT is also implicated in apoptosis. Here, we investigated factors regulating how cell death switches from necrosis to apoptosis after ischemia/reperfusion injury.   METHODS Overnight cultured rat hepatocytes were incubated in anoxia at pH 6.2 for 4 hours and reoxygenated at pH 7.4 to simulate ischemia/reperfusion. Some cells were incubated with fructose plus glycine just before and then continuously after reperfusion. Development of apoptosis was evaluated by examining chromatin condensation, nuclear DNA fragmentation, and caspase 3 activity.   RESULTS Reperfusion with the glycolytic substrate fructose plus the cytoprotective amino acid glycine prevented necrotic cell killing. Instead, apoptosis developed within 12 hours as shown by nuclear chromatin changes, TUNEL staining, and caspase 3 activation. This apoptotic cell killing was prevented by cyclosporin A, an MPT blocker, and by pancaspase and caspase 3 inhibition, but not by caspase 8 inhibition. Cyclosporin A also blocked caspase-3 activation. Reperfusion with glycine alone prevented necrotic cell death but did not induce apoptosis and only poorly promoted recovery of ATP, whereas fructose alone during reperfusion promoted both ATP recovery and apoptosis.   CONCLUSIONS Glycolytic ATP generation after reperfusion prevents necrotic killing of hepatocytes after simulated ischemia/reperfusion despite onset of the MPT. Instead, the MPT promotes caspase-and ATP-dependent apoptosis. Thus, the MPT is a common mechanism responsible for both necrosis and apoptosis after ischemia/reperfusion."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"This study evaluated the time-dependent modes of cell death that occur during the course of reperfusion after 60 min ischemia. The serum ALT level increased immediately after reperfusion, peaked at 6 h and then declined gradually thereafter. This was supported by the HampE staining of the liver tissues taken at 2 h reperfusion, which revealed massive peri-portal necrosis. The succinate driven mitochondrial-swelling rate, release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm, increase in caspase-3 activity and TUNEL stained tissue were measured to determine the changes in the biochemical markers of apoptosis. The biochemical markers of apoptosis increased by 2 h of reperfusion, peaked at 6 h and remained elevated throughout the 24 h reperfusion period. Cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition MPT, inhibited MPT opening, the release of cytochrome c and caspase-3 activation. This indicates that necrotic death occurs particularly in the peri-portal region in the initial period of reperfusion, and delayed apoptotic death occurs primarily in the peri-central region in the liver tissues undergoing I/R."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"The role of intracellular free zinc and its chelation by TPEN N,N,N,N- tetrakis2-pyridylmethylethylene-diamine was studied in Bowes human melanoma cells. The content of free Zn pools was determined by fluorescent probe Zinquin. Depletion of zinc triggered apoptosis confirmed by cell blebbing, changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and GSH levels, caspase-3 activation and nuclear fragmentation. Apoptosis was only partially prevented by cyclosporin A or N-acetylcystein, suggesting various independent but likely interrelated mechanisms participating in this process."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Acetaminophen overdose causes massive hepatic failure via mechanisms involving glutathione depletion, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The ultimate target of acetaminophen causing cell death remains uncertain, and the role of apoptosis in acetaminophen-induced cell killing is still controversial. Our aim was to evaluate the mitochondrial permeability transition MPT as a key factor in acetaminophen-induced necrotic and apoptotic killing of primary cultured mouse hepatocytes. After administration of 10 mmol/L acetaminophen, necrotic killing increased to more than 49 and 74, respectively, after 6 and 16 hours. MPT inhibitors, cyclosporin A CsA, and NIM811 temporarily decreased necrotic killing after 6 hours to 26, but cytoprotection was lost after 16 hours. Confocal microscopy revealed mitochondrial depolarization and inner membrane permeabilization approximately 4.5 hours after acetaminophen administration. CsA delayed these changes, indicative of the MPT, to approximately 11 hours after acetaminophen administration. Apoptosis indicated by nuclear changes, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, and caspase-3 activation also increased after acetaminophen administration. Fructose 20 mmol/L, an adenosine triphosphate-generating glycolytic substrate plus glycine 5 mmol/L, a membrane stabilizing amino acid prevented nearly all necrotic cell killing but paradoxically increased apoptosis from 37 to 59 after 16 hours. In the presence of fructose plus glycine, CsA decreased apoptosis and delayed but did not prevent the MPT. In conclusion, after acetaminophen a CsA-sensitive MPT occurred after 3 to 6 hours followed by a CsA-insensitive MPT 9 to 16 hours after acetaminophen. The MPT then induces ATP depletion-dependent necrosis or caspase-dependent apoptosis as determined, in part, by ATP availability from glycolysis."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"FK506 is a potent immunosuppressive drug used for the prevention of graft rejection in organ transplantation. Experimental and clinical studies have shown correlations between apoptosis and graft rejection, and apoptosis also plays a role in cell death after ischemia-reperfusion injury in the rat liver. Fas-mediated apoptosis is very likely involved in allograft rejection and experimental evidence has shown a decrease of FasR expression in mouse hepatocytes produced by the drugs. On the basis of these findings we have investigated the protective effect of FK506 in comparison with cyclosporine A CsA on Fas-induced apoptosis, by analysing the activation of downstream effector caspases in human hepatocytes. Apoptosis was induced by treatment with agonistic antibodies against FasR, which resulted in a significant activation of caspase-3 after 12 h. Prevention of the downstream activation of the caspase cascade and apoptosis was observed when hepatocytes were pre-treated for 3 h with immunosuppressant drugs. A significant reduction ca. 30-40 of caspase-3 activation by 5 microM FK506 and CsA was observed. Along with less activation of caspase-3 a decrease of apoptotic DNA fragmentation was found. In addition, FK506 significantly reduced not only caspase-8 but also caspase-9 activation, to a similar extent as CsA, thus suggesting a protective effect at the mitochondrial level of this drug, as has already been reported for CsA. These effects of FK506 help to explain its strong anti-rejection properties and suggest promising benefits of pharmacological preconditioning on ischemia-reperfusion injury following liver transplantation."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"We attempted to determine whether docosahexaenoic acid DHA-induced apoptosis is mediated via the Bax-mediated pathway in human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells. DHA-induced apoptosis was confirmed by morphological analysis and caspase-3 activation. But, cyclosporin A CsA, an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition MPT, did not inhibit DHA-induced Bax translocation to mitochondria or caspase-3 activation. These data suggest that DHA can induce apoptosis via the Bax-independent pathway."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"OBJECTIVE Oxidized low-density lipoprotein oxLDL-induced apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells may contribute to plaque erosion and rupture. We aimed to clarify the relationship between the oxLDL-induced calcium signal and induction of apoptotic pathways.   METHODS AND RESULTS Apoptosis was evaluated by biochemical methods, including studies of enzyme activities, protein processing, release of proapoptotic factors, chromatin cleavage, and especially by morphological methods that evaluate apoptosis/necrosis by SYTO-13/propidium iodide fluorescent labeling. The oxLDL-induced sustained calcium rise activated 2 distinct calcium-dependent mitochondrial apoptotic pathways in human microvascular endothelial cells. OxLDLs induced calpain activation and subsequent Bid cleavage and cytochrome C release, which were blocked by calpeptin. Cyclosporin-A inhibited cytochrome C release, possibly by inhibiting the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore mPTP. Calcineurin, another cyclosporin-sensitive step, was not implicated, because oxLDLs inhibited calcineurin and FK-506 treatment was ineffective. Cytochrome C release in turn induced caspase-3 activation. In addition, oxLDLs triggered release and nuclear translocation of mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor through a mechanism dependent on calcium but independent of calpains, mPTP, and caspases.   CONCLUSIONS OxLDL-induced apoptosis involves 2 distinct calcium-dependent pathways, the first mediated by calpain/mPTP/cytochrome C/caspase-3 and the second mediated by apoptosis-inducing factor, which is cyclosporin-insensitive and caspase-independent."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Classical transplantation immunosuppression relies heavily upon the interruption of interleukin-2 IL-2 signaling by calcineurin inhibition. However, recent evidence in murine models suggests that IL-2 is necessary for activation-induced cell death AICD of allograft-specific lymphocytes.   METHODS We examined the apoptotic effects of the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A and mTOR inhibitor rapamycin on the apoptotic alterations that occur in allospecifically activated human lymphocytes in a one-way mixed lymphocyte culture MLC.   RESULTS Cyclosporine increased caspase-3 activation in MLC, which corresponded with a decrease in lymphocyte apoptosis in MLC. Cyclosporine also reduced apoptosis in the CD4 helper T cell subset, while CD8 cells had similar or increased apoptosis when compared to controls. In contrast, rapamycin-treated cultures had normal levels of CD4 T cell apoptosis when compared to control MLC, with decreases seen in CD8 T lymphocytes.   CONCLUSIONS In humans, blockade of IL-2 receptor signal with rapamycin allows apoptosis of allospecifically activated CD4 lymphocytes to occur, while blockade of IL-2 production with cyclosporine results in decreased apoptosis in this T cell subset. As helper T cells are integral to the immune response, these results may explain the tolerogenic effects of rapamycin."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Cadmium Cd2 is a highly toxic metal that affects the endocrine system. We have previously shown that Cd2 induces caspase-3 activation and apoptosis of anterior pituitary cells and that endogenous nitric oxide NO protects these cells from Cd2. Here we investigate the mechanisms by which NO exerts this protective role. Cd2 25 microM reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential MMP as measured by flow cytometry. Cd2-induced apoptosis was mitochondrial dependent since cyclosporin A protected the cells from this metal. Inhibition of NO synthesis with 0.5 mM L-NAME increased the effect of Cd2 on MMP, whereas the NO donor DETANONOate 0.1 mM reduced it. Cd2 increased the production of reactive oxygen species ROS as measured by flow cytometry. This effect was electron-transfer-chain-dependent since it was inhibited by rotenone. In fact, rotenone reduced the cytotoxic effect of the metal. The action of Cd2 on mitochondrial integrity was ROS dependent. Trolox, an antioxidant, inhibited the effect of the metal on the MMP. Cd2-induced increase in ROS generation was reduced by DETANONOate. There are discrepancies concerning the role of NO in Cd2 toxicity. Here we show that NO reduces Cd2 toxicity by protecting the mitochondria from oxidative stress in a system where NO plays a regulatory role."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Defects in mitochondrial function have been shown to participate in the induction of neuronal cell injury. The aim of the present study was to assess the influence of the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition inhibition against the toxicity of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium MPP and 6-hydroxydopamine 6-OHDA in relation to the mitochondria-mediated cell death process and role of oxidative stress. Both MPP and 6-OHDA induced the nuclear damage, the changes in the mitochondrial membrane permeability, leading to the cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation, the formation of reactive oxygen species and the depletion of GSH in differentiated PC12 cells. Cyclosporin A CsA, trifluoperazine and aristolochic acid, inhibitors of mitochondrial permeability transition, significantly attenuated the MPP-induced mitochondrial damage leading to caspase-3 activation, increased oxidative stress and cell death. In contrast to MPP, the cytotoxicity of 6-OHDA was not reduced by the addition of the mitochondrial permeability transition inhibitors. The results show that the cytotoxicity of MPP may be mediated by the mitochondrial permeability transition formation, which is associated with formation of reactive oxygen species and the depletion of GSH. In contrast, the 6-OHDA-induced cell injury appears to be mediated by increased oxidative stress without intervention of the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"FK506, a calcineurin inhibitor, shows potent neuroprotective effects in animal models such as those of stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanism underlying these neuroprotective effects is unclear. In this study, an in vitro model, in which FK506 protected the cells against cell death, was established and analyzed in detail by pharmacological experiments. Thapsigargin TG, an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase, induced SH-SY5Y cell death. FK506 concentration-dependently protected the cells from this type of death. In contrast, FK506 did not suppress SH-SY5Y cell death caused by the following molecules tunicamycin TM, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation etoposide Eto, a topoisomerase II inhibitor and staurosporine STS, a phospholipid/calcium-dependent protein kinase inhibitor. Additionally, FK506 did not inhibit TG-induced cell death in either SK-N-MC or HeLa cell lines. FK506 completely inhibited caspase-3 activation and apoptosis caused by TG in a concentration-dependent manner, but not that caused by TM, Eto, and STS. TG did not activate caspase-3 in SK-N-MC cells, although it slightly activated caspase-3 in HeLa cells. FK506 did not change caspase-3 activity in either SK-N-MC or HeLa cell lines. Cyclosporin A, another calcineurin inhibitor, showed the same results as FK506 in this study, whereas rapamycin, an immunosuppressant not associated with calcineurin activity, did not have any effect in this context. Thus, the suppressive effects of FK506 on cell death are specific to SH-SY5Y cells treated with TG and are caused by the inhibition of calcineurin and subsequent suppression of caspase-3 activation. Therefore, an in vitro system using SH-SY5Y cells treated with TG could provide a model reflective of certain aspects of the neuroprotective activity of FK506."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Axotomy induces apoptosis in motoneurons of neonatal rodents. To identify the key players in motoneuron apoptosis, we assessed the progression of apoptosis at 4 h intervals following facial motoneuron axotomy. The mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, caspase-3 activation and nuclear condensation were first observed in the motoneuron cell bodies 16 h postaxotomy. In vivo application of inhibitors of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, Bongkrekic acid and cyclosporin A prevented cytochrome c release as well as caspase-3 activation and attenuated motoneuron apoptosis. Similarly, in vivo application of RU360, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, also protected axotomized motoneurons from apoptosis. Taken together, our results show that cytochrome c release and subsequent caspase-3 activation are critical events that precipitate the apoptotic death of axotomized neonatal motoneurons in vivo. In addition, these results provide evidence that application of mitochondrial pore inhibitors in vivo can block the induction of apoptosis following motoneuron axotomy."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in cell death in many neurodegenerative diseases. Diminished activity of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex KGDHC, a key and arguably rate-limiting enzyme of the Krebs cycle, occurs in these disorders and may underlie decreased brain metabolism. The present studies used alpha-keto-beta-methyl-n-valeric acid KMV, a structural analogue of alpha-ketoglutarate, to inhibit KGDHC activity to test effects of reduced KGDHC on mitochondrial function and cell death cascades in PC12 cells. KMV decreased in situ KGDHC activity by 52 /- 7 1 hr or 65 /- 4 2 hr. Under the same conditions, KMV did not alter the mitochondrial membrane potential MMP, as assessed with a method that detects changes as small as 5. KMV also did not alter production of reactive oxygen species ROS. However, KMV increased lactate dehydrogenase LDH release from cells by 100 /- 4.7, promoted translocation of mitochondrial cytochrome c to the cytosol, and activated caspase-3. Inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore MPTP by cyclosporin A CsA partially blocked this KMV-induced change in cytochrome c -40 and LDH -15 release, and prevented necrotic cell death. Thus, impairment of this key mitochondrial enzyme in PC12 cells may lead to cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation by partial opening of the MPTP before the loss of mitochondrial membrane potentials."
Cyclosporin A,COX-2 inhibition,"BACKGROUND It is known that inhibition of cyclooxygenase COX impairs the renal actions of loop diuretics. Recently, we found that cyclosporine A CsA inhibits renal COX-2 expression. Therefore, we examined the interferences of CsA with the renal actions of loop diuretics.   METHOD We investigated the renal effects of furosemide administration 12 mg/day subcutaneously in male Sprague-Dawley rats receiving in addition vehicle, CsA 15 mg/kg x day, rofecoxib 10 mg/kg x day, or a combination of both.   RESULTS CsA, rofecoxib, and their combination lowered the furosemide-induced increase of prostaglandin E2 PGE2 and of 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha 6-keto PGF1 alpha excretion by 55 and by 70. They also lowered furosemide stimulated renal excretion of sodium and water by about 65 and 60. Basal as well as furosemide-induced stimulation of plasma renin activity PRA and of renal renin mRNA was further enhanced by CsA. In contrast, rofecoxib attenuated the furosemide-induced rise of PRA and of renin mRNA, both in the absence and in the presence of CsA. In addition, the increase in plasma 6-keto PGF1 alpha levels by furosemide was further enhanced by CsA and was attenuated by rofecoxib.   CONCLUSION Taken together, our data suggest that CsA acts as an antinatriuretic, likely by the inhibition of COX-2-mediated renal prostanoid formation. Since the furosemide-induced stimulation of the renin system is not attenuated by CsA but by COX-2 inhibition, we speculate that extrarenal COX-2-derived prostanoids may be involved in the stimulation of the renin system by CsA and by loop diuretics."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"This study was undertaken to examine the possibilities of endothelial protection toward toxicity of anticancer drugs. To test the hypothesis that estradiol E2 and cyclosporin A CsA can interfere within programmed cell death in human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVECs, apoptosis was induced by etoposide with and without E2 or CsA. All the concentrations of E2 tested from 10-9 to 10-5 M failed to protect HUVECs. For CsA a dual effect was observed used at 1 or 10 microg/mL in coincubation with etoposide, CsA significantly reduced etoposide-induced apoptosis but complete inhibition was not reached, whereas used at 50 microg/mL CsA did not protect HUVECs anymore and even had deleterious effects. Furthermore, a 24-h pretreatment of HUVECs by CsA at 10 microg/mL significantly protected the cells by preventing both bcl-2 level decrease and caspase-3 activation related to etoposide-induced apoptosis. Protective effects of CsA toward endothelial cells were concentration dependent in pretreatment at 10 microg/mL, CsA was an effective protector and might contribute in vivo to inhibit obvious toxic effects caused by anticancer drugs."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Bilirubin is the principal end product of heme degradation. Prompted by epidemiologic analyses demonstrating an inverse correlation between serum bilirubin levels and cancer mortality, we examined the effects of bilirubin on the growth and survival of colon adenocarcinoma cells. Adenocarcinoma cell monolayers were treated with bilirubin over a range of bilirubinBSA molar ratios 0-0.6, and viability was assessed colorimetrically. Apoptosis was characterized by TUNEL assay, annexin V staining and caspase-3 activation. The mechanisms by which bilirubin induces apoptosis was investigated by Western blotting for cytochrome c release, assaying for caspase-8 and caspase-9 activation and for mitochondrial depolarization by JC-1 staining. The direct effect of bilirubin on the membrane potential of isolated mitochondria was evaluated using light-scattering and fluorescence techniques. Bilirubin decreased the viability of all colon cancer cell lines tested in a dose-dependent manner. Cells exhibited substantial apoptosis when exposed to bilirubin concentrations ranging 0-50 microM, as demonstrated by an 8- to 10-fold increase in TUNEL and annexin V staining and in caspase-3 activity. Bilirubin treatment evokes specific activation of caspase-9, enhances cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm and triggers the mitochondrial permeability transition in colon cancer monolayers. Additionally, bilirubin directly induces the depolarization of isolated rat liver mitochondria, an effect that is not inhibited by cyclosporin A. Bilirubin stimulates apoptosis of colon adenocarcinoma cells in vitro through activation of the mitochondrial pathway, apparently by directly dissipating mitochondrial membrane potential. As this effect is triggered at concentrations normally present in the intestinal lumen, we postulate a physiologic role for bilirubin in modulating colon tumorigenesis."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Recent studies have suggested that apoptosis and necrosis share common features in their signaling pathway and that apoptosis requires intracellular ATP for its mitochondrial/apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 suicide cascade. The present study was, therefore, designed to examine the role of intracellular energy levels in determining the form of cell death in cardiac myocytes. Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were first incubated for 1 h in glucose-free medium containing oligomycin to achieve metabolic inhibition. The cells were then incubated for another 4 h in similar medium containing staurosporine and graded concentrations of glucose to manipulate intracellular ATP levels. Under ATP-depleting conditions, the cell death caused by staurosporine was primarily necrotic, as determined by creatine kinase release and nuclear staining with ethidium homodimer-1. However, under ATP-replenishing conditions, staurosporine increased the percentage of apoptotic cells, as determined by nuclear morphology and DNA fragmentation. Caspase-3 activation by staurosporine was also ATP dependent. However, loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential DeltaPsim, Bax translocation, and cytochrome c release were observed in both apoptotic and necrotic cells. Moreover, cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition, attenuated staurosporine-induced apoptosis and necrosis through the inhibition of DeltaPsim reduction, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activation. Our data therefore suggest that staurosporine induces cell demise through a mitochondrial death signaling pathway and that the presence of intracellular ATP favors a shift from necrosis to apoptosis through caspase activation."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Previous studies showed that exposure to Vibrio vulnificus cytolysin VVC caused characteristic morphologic changes and dysfunction of vascular structures in lung. VVC showed cytotoxicity for mammalian cells in culture and acted as a vascular permeability factor. In this study, the underlying mechanisms of VVC-induced cytotoxicity was investigated on ECV304 cell, a human vascular endothelial cell line. When cells were exposed to 0.4 hemolytic units HU of VVC, consecutive apoptotic events were observed the elevation of superoxide anion O -.2, the release of cytochrome c, the activation of caspase-3, the cleavage of polyADP-ribose polymerase, and the DNA fragmentation. The pretreatment with 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl TEMPO, O-. 2 scavenger, completely abolished O-.2 levels and downstream apoptotic events. Moreover, pretreatment with cyclosporin A CsA, a mitochondrial permeability transition inhibitor, was capable of attenuating O-.2-mediated cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation, and consequent apoptosis. Apoptosis, as demonstrated by oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and fluorescence microscopy, was induced 24 h after VVC treatment, which was also prevented by caspase-3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO. Caspase-1 inhibitor, Ac-YVAD-CHO, did not protect ECV 304 cells from apoptosis. These results suggest a scenario where VVC-induced apoptosis is triggered by the generation of O-.2, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, activation of caspase-3, degradation of polyADP-ribose polymerase, and DNA fragmentation. The induction of apoptosis in endothelial cells by VVC may provide a pivotal mechanism for understanding the pathophysiology of septicemia."
Cyclosporin A,caspase-3 activation,"Reperfusion of cultured astrocytes with normal medium after exposure to H2O2-containing medium causes apoptosis. We have recently shown that ibudilast, which has been used for bronchial asthma and cerebrovascular disorders, attenuated the H2O2-induced apoptosis of astrocytes via the cGMP signaling pathway. This study examines the mechanism underlying the protective effect of cGMP. The membrane-permeable cGMP analog dibutyryl-cGMP attenuated the H2O2-induced decrease in cell viability, DNA ladder formation, nuclear condensation, reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and caspase-3 activation in cultured astrocytes. These effects of dibutyryl-cGMP were almost completely inhibited by the cGMP-dependent protein kinase PKG inhibitor KT5823. In isolated rat brain mitochondria, cGMP in the presence of cytosolic extract from astrocytes inhibited the mitochondrial permeability transition pore PTP as determined by monitoring Ca2-induced mitochondrial swelling. This ability of the cytosolic extract was inactivated by heat treatment and was mimicked by exogenous PKG. The effect of cGMP on the mitochondrial swelling was blocked by KT5823. The PTP inhibitors cyclosporin A and bongkrekic acid prevented the H2O2-induced decrease in cell viability and caspase-3 activation. These findings demonstrate that cGMP inhibits the mitochondrial PTP via the activation of PKG, and the prevention of mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to its anti-apoptotic effect."
Cyclosporin A,estrogen receptor activity,"Estrogen and androgen receptors within the liver have been reported to modulate the hepatic regenerative response to partial hepatectomy. Moreover, cyclosporine has several untoward effects that might occur as a consequence of alterations in sex hormone activity. To evaluate these questions the following experiments were performed. Estrogen and androgen receptors in cytosol were quantitated in livers of rats treated with cyclosporine or olive oil vehicle before and after partial hepatectomy or a sham operation. Ornithine decarboxylase activity and thymidine kinase activity were assessed as indices of hepatic regeneration. Preoperative levels of estrogen receptor activity in the hepatic cytosol were significantly greater in rats treated with cyclosporine as compared to vehicle treated controls P less than 0.01. In contrast, preoperative levels of androgen receptor activity in the cyclosporine-treated and vehicle-treated animals were similar. Following partial hepatectomy, a reduction in the activity of both sex hormone receptors in the hepatic cytosol was observed and was compatible with results described previously in normal animals. Unexpectedly the preoperative levels of ornithine decarboxylase P less than 0.01 and thymidine kinase activity P less than 0.01 were significantly greater in the rats treated with cyclosporine as compared to the vehicle treated controls. As expected, ornithine decarboxylase activity at 6 hr and thymidine kinase activity at 24 hr rose and peaked in response to a partial hepatectomy but were significantly greater P less than 0.05 in the rats treated with cyclosporine as compared to the vehicle.ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS"
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"Dexamethasone DX induces apoptosis resistance in most solid malignant tumors during co-treatment with chemotherapy agents, such as camptothecin CAM. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which DX reduces chemotherapy efficiency in C6-glioma. DX reduced CAM-increased DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation. The DXs protection was negated by RU486, an antagonist of glucocorticoid receptor GR. DX itself increased anti-apoptotic gene, Bcl-xL expression, and its transcription factor, signaling transducer and activator of transcription 5 Stat5, DNA binding activity and phospho-Stat5 expression. DX blocked the CAM-decreased Bcl-xL and phospho-Stat5 expression, and Stat5 binding activity. RU486 negated DXs actions. To determine whether Stat5 regulates Bcl-xL expression in CAM-induced cell death, C6-glioma was infected with an adenovirus containing a constitutively activated Stat5-GFP Ad-Stat5ca. Overexpression of Stat5ca increased Bcl-xL and decreased CAM-induced cell death compared to control adenovirus infected cells whereas Stat5 siRNA decreased DX-induced Bcl-xL and increased cell death. Phospho-Stat5 expression was observed in the nuclear extract by co-immunoprecipitation with an anti-GR antibody, indicating that Stat5 and GR were interactive and formed a complex in the nuclei. These results suggest that DXs prevention from CAM-induced apoptosis and RU486s antagonism of DXs protection may be through Stat5/Bcl-xL signal pathway regulated by a GR."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"Despite major advances, multiple myeloma MM remains an incurable malignancy. Recently we have found that disease stabilization was achieved in 64 of patients with advanced MM treated with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor R115777 Zarnestra in a phase 2 clinical trial. In order to enhance R115777 antitumor activity in MM, we examined the combination of this novel agent with other anticancer drugs in MM cell lines. In this study, R115777 was found to synergize with paclitaxel and docetaxel, but not with other chemotherapy agents, including doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, cisplastin, melphalan, mitoxantrone, and dexamethasone. R115777 synergized with paclitaxel to inhibit MM cell proliferation and to induce apoptosis. Synergism in the induction of apoptosis was accompanied by increase in cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis also showed that paclitaxel and R115777 synergized to induce G2/M cell-cycle arrest. Importantly, synergism was observed in taxane- and R115777-resistant MM cells. In the human severe combined immunodeficient SCID-hu bone model of myeloma growth, the ability of paclitaxel to inhibit tumor growth in vivo was enhanced by R115777. Combination of paclitaxel or docetaxel with R115777 in the treatment of MM cells from patients with multiple myeloma was more beneficial than treatment with single agents. Our results provide the basis for combination therapy clinical trials with paclitaxel or docetaxel with R115777 in MM patients."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"Nix, a hypoxia-sensitive member of the Bcl-2 family, is upregulated at the mRNA level during hypoxia through induction of a hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha HIF-1 alpha response element in its promoter sequence. However, the mechanisms regulating Nix protein activation remain unclear. The present studies examine Nix protein expression and subcellular distribution in response to hypoxic stimuli in vivo and in culture and to two disparate apoptotic stimuli in vitro. Upregulation and translocation of Nix by day 5 in hypoxic/serum-deprived CHO-K1 cells, was preceded by Bax activation by day 4 and caspase-3 processing by day 2, suggesting that initiation of cell death in vitro is a Nix-independent event. In contrast, an early Nix response upregulation and translocation to the mitochondria was observed after 6 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat. Nix translocation was observed in the ipsilateral cortex and striatum before other histological infarct development, neuronal loss, apoptotic body formation or biochemical Bax activation or caspase-3 cleavage markers of damage were detected. While fundamental differences between hypoxia/ischaemia in culture and in vivo likely explain the different temporal profiles of Nix, Bax, and caspase-3 activation observed, these studies show that like Bax, mitochondrial accumulation is a common event during Nix activation. These are the first studies to show upregulation and translocation of Nix in the ischaemic brain and suggest Nix to be a novel therapeutic target in ischaemic research. Moreover, Nix upregulation in staurosporine-treated SH-SY5Y cells and dexamethasone-treated A1.1 cells supports a more generalized role for Nix in apoptotic cell death."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"In the setting of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury IRI, the effect and mechanism of action of glucocorticoids are not well understood. In rat renal IRI, a single dose of dexamethasone administered before ischemia, or at the onset of reperfusion, ameliorated biochemical and histologic acute kidney injury after 24 h. Dexamethasone upregulated Bcl-xL, downregulated ischemia-induced Bax, inhibited caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, and reduced apoptosis and necrosis of proximal tubular cells. In addition, dexamethasone decreased the number of infiltrating neutrophils and ICAM-1. We observed the protective effect of dexamethasone in neutrophil-depleted mice, suggesting a neutrophil-independent mechanism. In vitro, dexamethasone protected human kidney proximal tubular HK-2 cells during serum starvation and IRI-induced apoptosis, but inhibition of MEK 1/2 abolished its anti-apoptotic effects in these conditions. Dexamethasone stimulated rapid and transient phosphorylation of ERK 1/2, which required the presence of the glucocorticoid receptor and was independent of transcriptional activity. In summary, in the setting of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, dexamethasone directly protects against kidney injury by a receptor-dependent, nongenomic mechanism."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"Glucocorticoids are widely used in anti-myeloma therapy and their action is potentiated by rapamycin, a mTOR inhibitor. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly characterized. We show here that dexamethasone Dex-induced apoptosis in MM.1S and OPM-2 cells is characterized by Bax and Bak conformational changes, DeltaPsim loss, cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation. Rapamycin, which had minimal cytotoxic effect by itself, strongly potentiated Dex-induced apoptosis. Apoptotic gene expression profiling showed an increase in mRNA levels of Bim in MM.1S cells after Dex treatment and further increases in both cell lines when co-treated with rapamycin. Western blot analysis revealed a moderate increase in Bim protein levels in both MM.1S and OPM-2 cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that most Bim was complexed to Mcl-1 in untreated cells. Upon treatment with Dex, and specially Dex plus rapamycin, Bim-Mcl-1 complex was disrupted and Bim was found associated to a CHAPS-insoluble fraction. Overexpression of Mcl-1 stabilized Bim-Mcl-1 complexes upon treatment with Dex or Dexrapamycin and fully prevented apoptosis. Gene silencing of Bim inhibited for the most part Dex-induced apoptosis and, to a large extent, apoptosis induced by Dex plus rapamycin. These results, taken together, indicate that Bim protein is the key mediator of apoptosis induced by Dex and also responsible for the potentiating effect of rapamycin, providing molecular criteria for the use of glucocorticoids combined with mTOR inhibitors in myeloma therapy."
Dexamethasone,COX-2 inhibition,"Cyclooxygenase COX-2 levels are elevated in several types of human cancer tissues. Nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs inhibit both the COX-1 and COX-2 protein, the two enzymes that convert arachidonic acids to prostaglandins. Regular use of such NSAIDs significantly reduces the risk and spread of some cancers. The objective of this study was to elucidate the molecular pathology of neoplasms that overexpress COX-2. Epidemiological data and clinical studies were analyzed and compared with results of studies of human tumor tissues, animal models, and cultured tumor cells. COX-2, but not COX-1, is highly expressed in human colon carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, and skin cancer. COX-2 is inducible by oncogenes ras and scr, interleukin-1, hypoxia, benzoapyrene, ultraviolet light, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Dexamethasone, antioxidants, and tumor-suppressor protein p53 suppress COX-2 expression. COX-2 synthesizes prostaglandin E2 PGE2 which stimulates bcl-2 and inhibits apoptosis, and induces interleukin-6 IL-6 which enhances haptoglobin synthesis. PGE2 is associated with tumor metastases, IL-6 with cancer cell invasion, and haptoglobin with implantation and angiogenesis. Drastic reduction in polyp number results from COX-2 gene knockout as well as from selective COX-2 inhibition in a mouse model of human familial adenomatous polyposis. Nonselective NSAIDs, for instance aspirin, and selective COX-2 inhibitors such as celecoxib SC-58635 and NS-398 suppress azoxymethane-induced colon carcinogenesis in rats. Aspirin, indomethacin, and ibuprofen decrease cultured lung cancer cell proliferation. Selective inhibition of COX-2 is preferable to nonselective inhibition. It reduces cancer cell proliferation, induces cancer cell apoptosis, and spares COX-1-induced cytoprotection of the gastrointestinal tract."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"Tumour necrosis factor-alpha TNF-alpha- and lipopolysaccharide LPS-induced apoptosis of bovine glomerular endothelial cells is now recognized as an important part in the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis characterized by early mitochondrial cytochrome c release, mitochondrial permeability transition, Bak protein upregulation, Bcl-XL protein downregulation and caspase-3 activation. Co-treatment of cells with 10 nM dexamethasone and TNF-alpha or LPS blocked roughly 90 of apoptotic cell death in glomerular endothelial cells. The action of glucocorticoids could be documented in that they prevented all apoptotic markers such as DNA laddering, DNA fragmentation measured by the diphenylamine assay as well as morphological alterations. To mechanistically elucidate the action of glucocorticoids we evaluated whether glucocorticoids elicit a time-dependent effect. For dexamethasone, to maximally inhibit DNA fragmentation a preincubation period was not required. Even if dexamethasone was supplemented 6 h following TNF-alpha or LPS we observed a maximal inhibitory effect. Concerning its influence on TNF-alpha and LPS signal transduction, we found that dexamethasone only partially prevented cytochrome-c-release as a first sign of apoptotic cell death but efficiently blocked mitochondrial permeability transition. Moreover, TNF-alpha- and LPS-induced Bak upregulation, Bcl-XL-downregulation, and the activation of caspase-3-like proteases, measured fluorometrically using DEVD-AMC and PARP cleavage, were efficiently blocked by dexamethasone. We postulate that glucocorticoids exert their inhibitory action upstream of the terminal death pathways but downstream of primary receptor mediated signals by blocking pro-apoptotic signals pre- and/or post cytochrome c release and mitochondrial signalling."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Exposure to an ototoxic level of an aminoglycoside can result in hearing loss. In this we study investigated the otoprotective efficacy of dexamethasone DXM, melatonin MLT and tacrolimus TCR in gentamicin GM-treated animals and cultures. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Wistar rats were divided into controls treated with saline exposed to GM only GM and three GM-exposed groups treated with either DXM, MLT or TCR. Auditory function and cochlear surface preparations were studied. In vitro studies of oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA levels, the MAPK pathway and caspase-3 activation were performed in organ of Corti explants from 3-day-old rats. KEY RESULTS DXM, MLT and TCR decreased levels of reactive oxygen species in GM-exposed explants. The mRNA levels of TNF-, IL-1 and TNF-receptor type 1 were significantly reduced in GM  DXM and GM  MLT groups. Phospho-p38 MAPK levels decreased in GM  MLT and GM  TCR groups, while JNK phosphorylation was reduced in GM  DXM and GM  MLT groups. Caspase-3 activation decreased in GM  DXM, GM  MLT and GM  TCR groups. These results were consistent with in vivo results. Local treatment of GM-exposed rat cochleae with either DXM, MLT or TCR preserved auditory function and prevented auditory hair cell loss. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS In organ of Corti explants, GM increased oxidative stress and initiated an inflammatory response that led to the activation of MAPKs and apoptosis of hair cells. The three compounds tested demonstrated otoprotective properties that could be beneficial in the treatment of ototoxicity-induced hearing loss."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"Glucocorticoids are the most common cause of secondary osteoporosis, which affects both women pre- and postmenopausal and men. In cases of prolonged treatment, glucocorticoids promote the loss and inactivation of the differentiational function of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells BMSCs, risking the development of skeletal system diseases such as osteoporosis. This study reports for the first time the protective effect of the antimalarial artemisinin against glucocorticoid-induced insults on primary cultured rat BMSCs. At relatively low concentrations, artemisinin treatment improved BMSC survival by promoting a decline of reactive oxygen species ROS production that correlated with the decrease of caspase-3 activation, LDH release, mitochondrial membrane potential m loss, and apoptosis induced by dexamethasone DEXA. In addition, artemisinin improved the osteogenic differentiation of DEXA-damaged cells. DEXA inhibited extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ERK1/2 and cAMP response element binding protein CREB phosphorylation, and artemisinin treatment promoted their activation in a concentration-dependent manner. PD98059, the specific inhibitor of the ERK1/2 pathway, blocked ERK1/2 phosphorylation and artemisinin protection. Similarly, siCREB attenuated the protective effect of artemisinin, strongly suggesting the involvement of the ERK1/2-CREB pathway in the protective action of artemisinin against DEXA-induced damage in BMSCs. In addition, we found that the expression of antiapoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 protein BCL-2 was also upregulated by artemisinin. These studies demonstrate the therapeutic potential of artemisinin in the survival improvement of BMSCs exposed to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and suggest that artemisinin-mediated protection may occur via the activation of ERK1/2-CREB signaling pathway."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis GIO is one of the most common secondary forms of osteoporosis. GIO is partially due to the apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteocytes. In addition, high doses of dexamethasone DEX, a synthetic glucocorticoid receptor agonist, induces neurodegeneration by initiating inflammatory processes leading to neural apoptosis. Here, a neuroprotective bovine colostrum against glucocorticoid-induced neuronal damage was investigated for its anti-apoptotic activity in glucocorticoid-treated MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. A model of apoptotic osteoblastic cells was developed by exposing MC3T3-E1 cells to DEX 0-700 M. Colostrum co-treated with DEX was executed at 0.1-5.0 mg/mL. Cell viability was measured for all treatment schedules. Caspase-3 activation was assessed to determine both osteoblast apoptosis under DEX exposure and its potential prevention by colostrum co-treatment. Glutathione reduced GSH was measured to determine whether DEX-mediated oxidative stress-driven apoptosis is alleviated by colostrum co-treatment. Western blot was performed to determine the levels of p-ERK1/2, Bcl-XL, Bax, and Hsp70 proteins upon DEX or DEX plus colostrum exposure. Colostrum prevented the decrease in cell viability and the increase in caspase-3 activation and oxidative stress caused by DEX exposure. Cells, upon colostrum co-treated with DEX, exhibited higher levels of p-ERK1/2 and lower levels of Bcl-XL, Bax, and Hsp70. Our data support the notion that colostrum may be able to reduce DEX-induced apoptosis possibly via the activation of the ERK pathway and modulation of the Hsp70 system. We provided preliminary evidence on how bovine colostrum, as a complex and multi-component dairy product, in addition to its neuroprotective action, may affect osteoblastic cell survival undergoing apoptosis."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"Glucocorticoids GCs have a significant role in the adaptive response of the brain to stress. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that an increase of GC levels may induce neuronal cell death via apoptotic pathways. There is a correlation between over-production of reactive oxygen species ROS and an elevation in cytosolic calcium that causes a subsequent increase in the calcium-dependent death-process activation in GC-induced toxicity. Consequently, melatonin, via its antioxidant activity, exhibits a neuroprotective effect against apoptosis induced by intracellular calcium overload. Therefore, in the present study, we explored the protective effect of melatonin in GC-induced toxicity in dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells. Cellular treatment with the synthetic GCs, dexamethasone DEX, resulted in a marked decrease in cell viability and in the level of the calpain-inhibitor protein, calpastatin. DEX-induced toxicity also caused an increase in ROS production and the activation of the calcium-dependent cysteine protease, calpain, along with an increase in caspase-3 activation. Pretreatment of the cells with melatonin substantially prevented the decrease in cell viability, over-production of ROS and the activation of calpain and caspase-3, and reversed the depletion in calpastatin levels. These results suggest that melatonin may exert its protective effects against the calpain- and caspase-dependent death process in DEX-induced neurotoxicity."
Dexamethasone,COX-2 inhibition,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE The fruit hull of Garcinia mangostana Linn. has been used in traditional medicine for treatment of various inflammatory diseases. Hence, this study aims to investigate the in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory effect of  mangostin M, a major compound present in Garcinia mangostana.   MATERIALS AND METHODS The in silico analysis of inflammatory mediators such as cyclooxygenase COX and nuclear factor-kappa B NF-kB were performed via molecular docking. Further evaluation of anti-inflammatory effect was conducted in lipopolysaccharide LPS induced RAW 264.7 macrophages. Suppression of activated NF-kB was analyzed by high content screening. M triggered inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 in vitro were studied using biochemical kit. The in vivo model used in this study was carrageenan-induced peritonitis model, where reduction in carrageenan-induced peritonitis is measured by leukocyte migration and vascular permeability. In addition, the evaluation of Ms effect on carrageenan induced TNF- and IL-1 release on peritoneal fluid was also carried out.   RESULTS Treatment with M could inhibit the LPS-induced NO production but not the viability of RAW 264.7. Similarly, M inhibited PGE2 production and the cytokines TNF- and IL-6. The COX catalyzed prostaglandin biosynthesis assay had showed selective COX-2 inhibition with a 53.06.01 inhibition at 20 g/ml. Apart from this, M was capable in repressing translocation of NF-kB into the nucleus. These results were concurrent with molecular docking which revealed COX-2 selectivity and NF-kB inhibition. The in vivo analysis showed that after four hours of peritonitis, M was unable to reduce vascular permeability, yet could decrease the total leukocyte migration particularly, neutrophils. Meanwhile, dexamethasone 0.5 mg/kg, successfully reduced vascular permeability. The levels of TNF- and IL-1 in peritoneal fluid was reduced significantly by M treatment.   CONCLUSION The current study supports the traditional use of Garcinia mangostana fruit hull for treatment of inflammatory conditions. In addition, it is clear that the anti-inflammatory efficacy of this plant is not limited to the presence of  and , but  also with significant activity."
Dexamethasone,COX-2 inhibition,"PURPOSE Mortality among cancer patients is more commonly due to the effects of metastasis and recurrence as opposed to the primary tumour. Various perioperative factors have been implicated in tumour growth, including anesthetic agents and analgesia techniques. In this narrative review, we integrate this information to present a summary of the best available evidence to guide the conduct of anesthesia for primary cancer surgery.   SOURCE We conducted a search of the PubMed database up to May 31, 2015 to identify relevant literature using the search terms ""anesthesia and metastases"", ""anesthetic drugs and cancer"", ""volatile anesthetic agents and cancer"", and ""anesthetic technique and cancer"".   PRINCIPAL FINDINGS There is conflicting evidence regarding volatile agents however, the majority of studies are in vitro, suggesting that these agents are associated with enhanced expression of tumourigenic markers as well as both proliferation and migration of cancer cells. Nitrous oxide has not been shown to have any effect on cancer recurrence. Local anesthetic agents may reduce the incidence of cancer recurrence through systemic anti-inflammatory action in addition to direct effects on the proliferation and migration of cancer cells. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs affect cancer cells via inhibition of cyclooxygenase 2 COX-2, which leads to reduced resistance of the cancer cell to apoptosis and reduced production of prostaglandins by cancer cells. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also suppress the cancer cell growth cycle through effects independent of COX-2 inhibition. Opioids have been shown to inhibit the function of natural killer cells and to stimulate cancer cell proliferation through effects on angiogenesis and tumour cell signalling pathways. Supplemental oxygen at the time of surgery has a proangiogenic effect on micrometastases, while the use of perioperative dexamethasone does not affect overall rates of cancer survival.   CONCLUSIONS Current laboratory research suggests that perioperative interventions may impact recurrence or metastasis through effects on cancer cell signalling, the immune response, or modulation of the neuroendocrine stress response. Further evidence is awaited from prospective randomized-controlled trials. Meanwhile, with limited data upon which to make strong recommendations, anesthesiologists should seek optimal anesthesia and analgesia for their patients based on individual risk-benefit analysis and best available evidence on outcomes other than cancer recurrence."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"Glucocorticoid hormones GCHs regulate normal and neoplastic lymphocyte development by exerting antiproliferative and/or apoptotic effects. We have previously shown that dexamethasone DEX-activated thymocyte apoptosis requires a sequence of events including interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor GR, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C PI-PLC, and acidic sphingomyelinase aSMase activation. We analyzed the mechanisms of GCH-activated apoptosis by focusing on GR-associated Src kinase, cytochrome c release, and caspase-8, -9, and -3 activation. We show here that PI-PLC binds to GR-associated Src kinase, as indicated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Moreover, DEX treatment induces PI-PLC phosphorylation and activation. DEX-induced PI-PLC phosphorylation, activation, and apoptosis are inhibited by PP1, a Src kinase inhibitor, thus suggesting that Src-mediated PI-PLC activation is involved in DEX-induced apoptosis. Caspase-9, -8, and -3 activation and cytochrome c release can be detected 1 to 2 hours after DEX treatment. Caspase-9 inhibition does not counter cytochrome c release, caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis. Caspase-8 inhibition counters cytochrome c release, caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis, thus suggesting that caspase-8 inhibitor can directly inhibit caspase-9 and/or that DEX-induced caspase-8 activation is upstream to mitochondria and can regulate caspase-3 directly or through cytochrome c release and the consequent caspase-9/caspase-3 activation. DEX-induced caspase-8 activation, like ceramide-induced caspase-8 activation, correlates with the formation of Fas-associated death domain protein FADD/caspase-8 complex. Caspase-8 activation is countered by the inhibition of macromolecular synthesis and of Src kinase, PI-PLC, and aSMase activation, suggesting it is downstream in the DEX-activated apoptotic pathway of thymocytes."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"Dexamethasone Dex, a glucocorticoid with strong anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities, has been shown to exhibit marked cytotoxicity and apoptosis in osteoblasts, but the underlying mechanisms have not yet been comprehensively investigated. P21Waf1/Cip1 p21 plays a critical role in the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis. The present study aims to investigate the role of p21 in Dex-induced apoptosis in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, and to explore its mechanisms. Results demonstrated that Dex-induced apoptosis decreased the phosphorylation of Akt in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, LY294002, an inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway enhanced the Dex-induced apoptosis of osteoblasts. On the contrary, insulin-like growth factor-1 IGF-1, an activator of PI3K/Akt, attenuated the apoptosis of Dex in MC3T3-E1 cells. The protein level of p21 was downregulated by shortening its half-life, which was associated with inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway by Dex. Furthermore, depletion of p21 by siRNA enhanced Dex-induced caspase-3 activation and ROS generation, and promoted apoptosis of MC3T3-E1 cells. In addition, suppression of p21 led to a reduction of Dex-induced upregulation of nuclear Nrf2 and heme oxygenase-1 HO-1 protein levels. These findings demonstrate that p21 depletion promotes Dex-induced apoptosis of MC3T3-E1 cells by inhibiting the antioxidant Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, which highlights the anti-apoptotic effect of p21 in MC3T3-E1 cells."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"Human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVECs undergo apoptosis in response to serum deprivation. We show that the nonspecific mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, spironolactone, protects from caspase-3 activation induced by serum deprivation in contrast to the selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, eplerenone, that is nonprotective. We also demonstrate that progesterone, hydrocortisone, and dexamethasone all protect HUVECs from serum-deprivation-induced caspase-3 activation, whereas aldosterone and dihydrotestosterone have no effect. Spironolactone has been demonstrated to display agonist activity only to the progesterone receptor PR, and we additionally show that spironolactone and progesterone, but not eplerenone, inhibit mitochondrial cytochrome c release and cleavage of nuclear poly ADP-ribose polymerase PARP and increase cell viability. Additionally, the PR antagonist mifepristone RU486 partially blocked the inhibitory effect of both spironolactone and progesterone on caspase-3 activation, cytochrome c release, and nuclear PARP cleavage. Nitric oxide NO protects HUVECs from apoptosis in response to various stimuli including serum-deprivation however, the NO synthase inhibitor N-monomethyl-l-arginine, did not abolish inhibition of caspase-3 activation or PARP cleavage by spironolactone. Thus, we demonstrate that spironolactone protects HUVECs from serum-deprivation-induced apoptosis by inhibition of caspase-3 activity, cytochrome c release and PARP cleavage by a NO-independent mechanism further, this effect is likely mediated by the agonist properties of spironolactone toward the PR."
Dexamethasone,COX-2 inhibition,"Ichnocarpus frutescens, a climber plant, is distributed all over India. As its different parts are used as anti-inflammatory agent, so we re-investigated the roots to isolate compounds and evaluate its biological efficacy. Also, in-silico molecular docking was carried out to elucidate the structure activity relationship SAR of isolated compounds toward identifies the drug target enzyme with validation, which was further supported by anti-inflammatory in-vitro and in-vivo experimental models. The compounds have been undertaken mainly to investigate the anti-inflammatory and analgesic efficacy along with molecular docking investigation followed by anti-proteinase, anti-denaturation and cyclooxygenase COX inhibition studies. Inflammatory cytokines like TNF- and IL-6 were assayed from lipopolysaccharides LPS and Concavallin CON A stimulated human PBMC derived macrophages by Enyme linked immune sorbent assay ELISA method. The purity index of the lead compound was determined by HPLC. The compounds were illustrated as 2-hydroxy tricosanoic acid 1, stigmasterol glucoside 2, stigmasterol 3, -sitosterol 4 and -sitosterol glucoside 5. The test molecules showed significant anti-denaturation, anti-proteinase and analgesic effect validated with docking study. Compounds exhibited anti-inflammatory and pain killing action due to dexamethasone like phytosterol property. Promising anti-denaturation and anti-proteinase activity offered by the compound 5, may hold its promise to fight against arthritis by rejuvenating the osteoblast cells and destroying the bone-resorpting complex of hydrated protein, bone minerals by secreting the acid and an enzyme collagenase along with pain management. The lead bioactive compound i.e. -sitosterol glucoside compound 5 demonstrated considerable anti-inflammatory activity showing more than 90 protection against the inflammatory cytokines at 50 M dose. The anti-denaturation and COX-2 inhibition shown by the compound 5 was also noteworthy with the significant IC50 ranging from 0.25 to 2.56 M that also supporting its future promise for developing as anti-inflammatory agent. Since the most bio-active compound 5 elicit promising acute anti-inflammatory action and peripheral anti-nociceptive pain killing action with a significant ED50 dose of 3.95 amp 2.84 mg/kg i.p. respectively in the in-vivo animal model. It could suggest its potentiality as a good in-vivo bio available agent to be an emerging anti-inflammatory drug regimen scaffold in the future. It also establishes significant in-vitro and in-vivo result co-relation. Therefore, the compound 5 could be believed as a potent lead for designing anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritic drug or pain killer without showing any untoward effect."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"As apoptotic pathways are commonly deregulated in breast cancer, exploring how mammary gland cell death is regulated is critical for understanding human disease. We show that primary mammary epithelial cells from protein kinase C delta PKC -/- mice have a suppressed response to apoptotic agents in vitro. In the mammary gland in vivo, apoptosis is critical for ductal morphogenesis during puberty and involution following lactation. We have explored mammary gland development in the PKC -/- mouse during these two critical windows. Branching morphogenesis was altered in 4- to 6-week-old PKC -/- mice as indicated by reduced ductal branching however, apoptosis and proliferation in the terminal end buds was unaltered. Conversely, activation of caspase-3 during involution was delayed in PKC -/- mice, but involution proceeded normally. The thymus also undergoes apoptosis in response to physiological signals. A dramatic suppression of caspase-3 activation was observed in the thymus of PKC -/- mice treated with irradiation, but not mice treated with dexamethasone, suggesting that there are both target- and tissue-dependent differences in the execution of apoptotic pathways in vivo. These findings highlight a role for PKC in both apoptotic and nonapoptotic processes in the mammary gland and underscore the redundancy of apoptotic pathways in vivo."
Dexamethasone,COX-2 inhibition,"Glucocorticoids GCs are effective anti-inflammatory agents widely used in the therapeutic approach to treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. Previous results suggest that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha PPAR-alpha, an intracellular transcription factor activated by fatty acids, plays a role in the control of inflammation. With the aim of characterizing the role of PPAR-alpha in GC-mediated anti-inflammatory activity, we tested the efficacy of dexamethasone DEX, a synthetic GC specific for glucocorticoid receptor, in an experimental model of lung inflammation, carrageenan-induced pleurisy, comparing mice lacking PPAR-alpha PPAR-alphaKO with wild-type WT mice. We also tested the possible synergism of combined treatment with DEX and clofibrate, a PPAR-alpha agonist. Results indicate that DEX-mediated anti-inflammatory activity is weakened in PPAR-alphaKO mice compared with WT controls, and that is increased in WT mice when combined with PPAR-alpha agonist treatment. In particular, DEX was less effective in PPAR-alphaKO, compared with WT mice, as evaluated by inhibition of NF-kappaB, of TNF-alpha production, of cell migration, of cycloxygenase-2 COX-2 and inducible nitric-oxide synthase activation. Interestingly enough, macrophages from PPAR-alphaKO were less susceptible to DEX-induced COX-2 inhibition in vitro compared with WT mice. However, PPAR-alpha transfection in PPAR-alphaKO macrophages, with consequent receptor expression, resulted in reconstitution of susceptibility to DEX-induced COX-2 inhibition to levels comparable with that obtained in WT macrophages. It is noteworthy that the DEX effect on macrophages in vitro was significantly increased in WT cells when combined with PPAR-alpha agonist treatment. These results indicate that PPAR-alpha can contribute to the anti-inflammatory activity of GCs."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"PURPOSE Prenylation is essential for membrane localization and participation of proteins in various signaling pathways. The following study was conducted to examine the importance of protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation for the regulation of lymphoma cell survival and proliferation.   EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Lymphoma cells were treated with the beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin, which inhibits protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation by the depletion of intracellular pools of farnesylpyrophosphate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. In addition, farnesyl transferase and geranylgeranyl transferase activities were specifically inhibited by FTI-277 and GGTI-298, respectively.   RESULTS Only inhibition of geranylgeranylation by lovastatin led to reduction of cell viability in lymphoma cell lines and purified tumor cells from lymphoma patients in a time- and dose-dependent way. Reduction in the number of viable cells was mediated by both induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation. In addition, GGTI-298 was more effective in induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation than FTI-277. Apoptosis induced by inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation was associated with a reduction of Mcl-1 protein levels, collapse of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and caspase-3 activation. Inhibition of proliferation resulted from the induction of G1 arrest. Furthermore, lovastatin at low concentrations sensitized lymphoma cells to dexamethasone, including cells resistant to this drug.   CONCLUSION These results indicate that protein geranylgeranylation is critical for the regulation of lymphoma tumor cell survival and proliferation and that pharmacological agents such as lovastatin or geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors, alone or in combination with other drugs, may be useful in the treatment of lymphoma."
Dexamethasone,COX-2 inhibition,"Inflammation plays an essential role in the human immune system, and anti-inflammatory compounds are important to promote health. However, the in vitro screening of these compounds is largely dependent on flat biology. Herein, we report our efforts in establishing a 3D inflammation murine macrophage model. Murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells were cultured on poly-caprolactone PCL scaffolds fabricated through an electrohydrodynamic jetting 3D printer and their behavior were examined. Cells on PCL scaffolds showed a 3D shape and morphology with multilayers and a lower proliferation rate. Moreover, macrophages were not activated by scaffold material PCL and 3D microenvironment. The 3D cells showed greater sensitivity to lipopolysaccharide stimulation with higher production activity of nitric oxide NO, nitric oxide synthases iNOS, and cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2. Additionally, the 3D macrophage model showed lower drug sensitivity to commercial anti-inflammatory drugs including aspirin, ibuprofen, and dexamethasone, and natural flavones apigenin and luteolin with higher IC50 for NO production and lower iNOS and COX-2 inhibition efficacy. Overall, the 3D macrophage model showed promise for higher accurate screening of anti-inflammatory compounds. We developed, for the first time, a 3D macrophage model based on a 3D-printed PCL scaffold that provides an extracellular matrix environment for cells to grow in the 3D dimension. 3D-grown RAW 264.7 cells showed different sensitivities and responses to anti-inflammatory compounds from its 2D model. The 3D cells have lower sensitivity to both commercial and natural anti-inflammatory compounds. Consequently, our 3D macrophage model could be applied to screen anti-inflammatory compounds more accurately and thus holds great potential in next-generation drug screening applications."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"AIMS Although a substantial role for 5 adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase AMPK has been established in regulating cardiac metabolism, a less studied action of AMPK is its ability to prevent cardiac cell death. Using established AMPK activators like dexamethasone DEX or metformin MET, the objective of the present study was to determine whether AMPK activation prevents tumour necrosis factor-alpha TNF-alpha induced apoptosis in adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes.   METHODS AND RESULTS Cardiomyocytes were incubated with DEX, MET, or TNF-alpha for varying durations 0-12 h. TNF-alpha-induced cell damage was evaluated by measuring caspase-3 activity and Hoechst staining. Protein and gene estimation techniques were employed to determine the mechanisms mediating the effects of AMPK activators on TNF-alpha-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Incubation of myocytes with TNF-alpha for 8 h has increased caspase-3 activation and apoptotic cell death, an effect that was abrogated by DEX and MET. The beneficial effect of DEX and MET was associated with stimulation of AMPK, which led to a rapid and sustained increase in Bad phosphorylation. This event reduced the interaction between Bad and Bcl-xL, limiting cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation. Addition of Compound C to inhibit AMPK reduced Bad phosphorylation and prevented the beneficial effects of AMPK against TNF-alpha-induced cytotoxicity.   CONCLUSION Our data demonstrate that although DEX and MET are used as anti-inflammatory agents or insulin sensitizers, respectively, their common property to phosphorylate AMPK promotes cardiomyocyte cell survival through its regulation of Bad and the mitochondrial apoptotic mechanism."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"We recently reported that heat shock protein 60 HSP60 via TLR4 signaling activates B cells and induces them to proliferate and secrete IL-10. We now report that HSP60 inhibits mouse B cell apoptosis, spontaneous or induced by dexamethasone or anti-IgM activation. Unlike HSP60 enhancement of B cell proliferation and IL-10 secretion, TLR4 signaling was not required for the inhibition of apoptosis by HSP60 nevertheless, MyD88 was essential. Inhibition of apoptosis by HSP60 was associated with up-regulation of the antiapoptotic molecules Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and survivin, maintenance of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and inhibition of caspase-3 activation. Moreover, B cells incubated with HSP60 manifested prolonged survival following transfer into recipient mice. These results extend the varied role of HSP60 in the innate regulation of the adaptive immune response."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"High dose glucocorticoid GC treatment induces osteoporosis partly via increasing osteoblast apoptosis. However, the mechanism of GC-induced apoptosis has not been fully elucidated. Osteoblast-derived tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 TIMP-1 was recently reported to be involved in bone metabolism. Our previous study demonstrated that TIMP-1 suppressed apoptosis of the mouse bone marrow stromal cell line MBA-1 pre-osteoblast induced by serum deprivation. Therefore, we tested the effect of the GC dexamethasone Dex on TIMP-1 production in murine osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells and further determined whether this action is associated with Dex-induced osteoblast apoptosis. Dex decreased TIMP-1 production in MC3T3-E1 cells, and this effect was blocked by the glucocorticoid receptor GR antagonists, RU486 and RU40555. Recombinant TIMP-1 protein reduced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis induced by Dex in MC3T3-E1 cells. In addition, the pro-apoptotic effect of the Dex was augmented by suppression of TIMP-1 with siRNA. Furthermore, mutant TIMP-1, which has no inhibitory effects on MMPs, yet protects MC3T3-E1 cells against Dex-induced apoptosis. Our study demonstrates that Dex suppresses TIMP-1 production in osteoblasts through GR, and this effect is associated with its induction of osteoblast apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic action of TIMP-1 is independent of its inhibitory effects on MMPs activities. The decrease in TIMP-1 production caused by Dex may contribute to the mechanisms of Dex-induced bone loss."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"Glucocorticoids GC act as potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents on a variety of immune cells. However, the exact mechanisms of their action are still unknown. Recently, we demonstrated that GC induce apoptosis in human peripheral blood monocytes. In the present study, we examined the signaling pathway in GC-induced apoptosis. Monocyte apoptosis was demonstrated by annexin V staining, DNA laddering, and electron microscopy. Apoptosis required the activation of caspases, as different caspase inhibitors prevented GC-induced cell death. In addition, the proteolytic activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 was observed. In additional experiments, we determined the role of the death receptor CD95 in GC-induced apoptosis. CD95 and CD95 ligand CD95L were up-regulated in a dose- and time-dependent manner on the cell membrane and also released after treatment with GC. Costimulation with the GC receptor antagonist mifepristone diminished monocyte apoptosis as well as CD95/CD95L expression and subsequent caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation. In contrast, the caspase inhibitor N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde suppressed caspase-3 activation and apoptosis, but did not down-regulate caspase-8 activation and expression of CD95 and CD95L. Importantly, GC-induced monocyte apoptosis was strongly abolished by a neutralizing CD95L mAb. Therefore, our data suggest that GC-induced monocyte apoptosis is at least partially mediated by an autocrine or paracrine pathway involving the CD95/CD95L system."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL accounts for 30 of all pediatric cancers. Currently available treatments exhibit toxicity and certain patients may develop resistance. Thus, less toxic and chemoresistance-reversal agents are required. In the present study, the potential effect of curcumin, a component of Curcuma longa, as a pharmacological co-adjuvant of several chemotherapeutic agents against ALL, including prednisone, 6-mercaptopurine, dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, l-asparaginase, vincristine, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, methotrexate and cytarabine, was investigated in the REH ALL cell line cultures treated in combination with chemotherapeutic agents and curcumin. The results of cell viability, gene expression and activation of NF-B and caspase 3 indicated that curcumin potentiates the anticancer effects of the aforementioned chemotherapeutic agents in the REH ALL cell line. Following treatment with the above chemotherapeutic agents, curcumin enhanced caspase-3 activation and downregulated nuclear factor-kappa B NF-B activation. Curcumin also downregulated the oxidative stress induced by certain chemotherapies. Notably, curcumin did not affect the gene expression of cell survival proteins such as B-cell lymphoma Bcl-2, Bcl-extra large, survivin, c-Myc and cyclin D1, which are regulated by the NF-B transcription factor. In conclusion, curcumin has the potential to improve the effect of chemotherapeutic agents against ALL."
Dexamethasone,EGFR signaling pathway,"The interaction between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment TME significantly influences tumorigenesis, so TME-targeted therapy has attracted widespread attention. We have previously demonstrated that the combination of dipyridamole, bestatin, and dexamethasone DBD mix, DBDx is effective against heterogeneous human pancreatic cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma in mouse xenograft models. To further expand the therapeutic potential of this drug combination, herein, we investigated the antitumor efficacy and the underlying mechanism of DBDx and the combination of DBDx and gefitinib in different mouse xenograft models of human non-small-cell lung cancer NSCLC. Three human cancer cell lines H460, PG, and A431 were used to determine the apoptosis and growth inhibition induced by DBDx, gefitinib, and their combinations. Changes in epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR signaling pathway-related proteins were analyzed following treatment using western blotting. In vitro, DBDx strongly inhibited the proliferation of tumor cells, whereas the combined treatment exhibited a significant synergistic effect. Compared with DBDx, the combination treatment further induced apoptosis and downregulated the expression of molecules associated with EGFR signaling pathway. In vivo, compared with DBDx alone, the combination treatment distinctly inhibited tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of human NSCLC. Overall, our results indicate that the combination of DBDx and gefitinib in the treatment of human NSCLC is very promising, which warrants further translational studies."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"Cycloheximide CHX is known to stimulate or to prevent apoptosis, according to the cell type used. We found that CHX, in a dose-dependent way, exerted the two opposite effects in B lymphocytes. CHXhigh 2.5 microg/mL inhibited protein synthesis gt90 and greatly increased B cell apoptosis but failed to prevent apoptosis induction by dexamethasone DEX or dibutyryl-cAMP dbcAMP, which is in opposition with CHX activity in thymocytes. On the contrary, CHXlow 0.05 microg/mL, modestly inhibited protein synthesis lt15 and reduced spontaneous as well as drug-induced apoptosis and further augmented the protection conferred by interleukin-4 or lipopolysaccharide. To examine the role of caspases in CHX effects, we used the broad spectrum peptide caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk it totally abrogated spontaneous as well as drug- and CHXhigh-induced cell death. Apoptosis was associated with CPP32/caspase-3 activation, since cleavage of CPP32/caspase-3 and caspase-3 activity were increased by DEX, dbcAMP as well as by CHXhigh treatment. Meanwhile, caspase-3 activity was reduced by CHXlow treatment. Therefore, CHX exerts opposite effects on B lymphocyte apoptosis which are associated with a dual action on caspase-3 activation."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"PURPOSE Treatment with glucocorticoids is a well known risk factor for cataract development, although the pathogenic mechanism has not been elucidated. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of glucocorticoids in cultured human lens epithelial cells.   METHODS Human lens epithelial cells HLECs were exposed to dexamethasone for 24 h. The number of viable cells was determined using the 3-4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide MTT assay, and proliferation was quantified using Ki-67. Apoptosis was investigated by measuring caspase-3 activity and by evaluating nuclear morphology of cells stained with Hoechst 33342. Mitochondria depolarization was measured using the potential-sensitive color, JC-1. Cells were assayed for changes in superoxide production using dihydroethidium HET, for alterations in peroxide production using dichlorofluorescein diacetate DCFH-DA, and for glutathione GSH variations using monochlorobimane MCB. Caspase-3 activity was also measured in HLECs simultaneously exposed to dexamethasone and the glucocorticoid antagonist, RU486.   RESULTS Low doses of dexamethasone 0.1 microM resulted in increased proliferation of HLECs. Apoptosis was increased in HLECs exposed to 1 microM, 10 microM, and 100 microM of dexamethasone as revealed by nuclear morphology studies. Apoptosis was also confirmed by measuring caspase-3 activation. No effect on superoxide production by dexamethasone was seen. There were no effects on GSH levels or mitochondrial depolarization either. Only the highest concentration of dexamethasone 100 microM caused an increase in peroxide production. In HLECs incubated with the glucocorticoid antagonist, RU486, apoptosis was induced at a lower concentration of dexamethasone 0.1 microM than with dexamethasone alone.   CONCLUSIONS Low doses of dexamethasone cause a moderate increase in proliferation of cultured HLECs. Slightly higher but still physiologically relevant concentrations of dexamethasone result in a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis. Dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in HLECs does not seem to involve oxidative mechanisms. The proapoptotic effect of dexamethasone does not appear to act through the glucocorticoid receptor. Effects on proliferation and/or dysregulation of apoptosis in lens epithelial cells may be an important factor in human steroid-induced posterior subcapsular cataract."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"High-potency glucocorticoids GC are used in the prophylaxis and treatment of neonatal bronchopulmonal dysplasia, but there is concern about side effects on the developing brain. Recently, the low-potency GC hydrocortisone HC has been suggested as an alternative to high-potency GC. We compared the neurotoxic effects of HC with the high-potency GC dexamethasone DEX in chicken cerebellum. A single dose of GC was injected into the egg at embryonic day 16 and the death of granule neurons in histologic sections of the cerebellar cortex was examined 24 h later. DEX and HC showed a similar dose-dependent induction of morphological apoptosis and caspase-3 activation in the internal granular layer. A doubling of the apoptosis rate compared to the basal rate was seen for the highest dose of DEX 5 mg/kg and medium dose of HC 1 mg/kg. In cultures of embryonic chicken cerebellar granule cells, DEX and HC increased cell death and induced rapid caspase-3 activation in a similar dose-dependent manner. Transfection of granule cells with a luciferase reporter gene revealed that the dose needed for the activation of gene transcription classical signalling pathway with DEX was much lower than for HC. In conclusion, HC does not present itself as a safer drug than DEX in this model. In addition, it appears that DEX and HC induce apoptosis in immature granule neurons via a non-genomic non-classical mechanism."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"OBJECTIVES Apelin is a recently discovered peptide that is the endogenous ligand for the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor APJ. Adipocytes can express and secrete apelin. Osteoblast can express apelin and APJ. The aim of this study was to investigate the action of apelin on apoptosis of human osteoblasts.   RESULTS Apelin inhibited human osteoblasts apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. Suppression of APJ with small-interfering RNA siRNA abolished the anti-apoptotic activity of apelin. Our study also showed an increased Bcl-2 protein expression and decreased Bax protein expression under the treatment of apelin. Apelin decreased cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation in human osteoblasts. Apelin activated phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase PI-3 kinase and Akt. The apelin-induced activation of Akt was blocked by suppression of APJ with siRNA. LY294002 a PI-3 kinase inhibitor or 1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-R-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate HIMO an Akt inhibitor abolished apelin induced activation of Akt, and, LY294002 or HIMO abolished the anti-apoptotic activity of apelin. Furthermore, apelin protects against apoptosis induced by the glucocorticoid dexamethasone.   CONCLUSIONS Apelin suppresses serum deprivation-induced apoptosis of human osteoblasts and the anti-apoptotic action is mediated via the APJ/PI-3 kinase/Akt signaling pathway."
Dexamethasone,PPARgamma activation,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs have been shown to modulate cyclooxygenase COX-2 expression, but the mechanisms involved are controversial and may be cell specific. We show in this study that indomethacin Indo, flurbiprofen Flur, and the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 induced COX-2 expression and markedly enhanced IL-1beta-induced COX-2 expression in human airway smooth muscle HASM cells. These effects were not reversed by exogenous PGE2, suggesting that they are prostanoid-independent. Indeed, PGE2 also induced and enhanced IL-1beta-induced COX-2 expression. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPAR alpha and PPARgamma not PPARbeta were expressed in HASM cells. PPARgamma activators ciglitizone Cig and 15-Deoxy-Delta12,14-PGJ2 15d-PGJ2, but not the PPARalpha activator WY-14643, mimicked the effect of NSAIDs on COX-2 expression. Treatment with Flur, NS-398, Cig, and 15d-PGJ2 alone, but not Indo and WY-14643, elevated COX activity however, neither enhanced IL-1beta-induced COX activity. Pretreatment with dexamethasone suppressed COX-2 expression, PGE2 release, and COX activity induced by NS-398, Cig, IL-1beta, alone or in combination. Unlike IL-1beta, NS-398 and Cig did not cause NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation, nor did they further enhance IL-1beta-induced NF-kappaB translocation, but they stimulated PPARgamma translocation. Indo, NS-398, Flur, and 15d-PGJ2, but not WY-14643, induced transcriptional activity of a COX-2 reporter construct containing the peroxisome proliferator response element PPRE on their own and enhanced the effect of IL-1beta, but had no effect on a COX-2 reporter construct lacking the PPRE. The results suggest that COX-2 expression by NSAIDs is biologically functional, prostanoid-independent, and involves PPARgamma activation, and provide the first direct evidence that the PPRE in the promoter is required for NSAID-induced COX-2 expression."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"Thymocytes undergo negative and positive selection during development in the thymus. During this selection process, the majority of thymocytes are eliminated by apoptosis through signaling via TCR or die by neglect, possibly mediated through glucocorticoids. In this study, we report that thymocytes require molecular oxygen to undergo apoptosis induced by dexamethasone DEX, a synthetic glucocorticoid, and treatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine NAC, a thiol antioxidant, inhibits thymocyte apoptosis in vivo as well as ex vivo. We detected elevated intracellular levels of hydrogen peroxide H2O2 during DEX-induced apoptosis, which is reduced by NAC treatment, indicating that the elevated levels of intracellular H2O2 are proapoptotic. We also show that loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, as well as caspase-3 activation induced by DEX are attenuated by NAC treatment. We identified the production site for H2O2 as the ubiquinone cycle at complex III of mitochondria by using various inhibitors of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and we show that the cell death events mediated by mitochondria are also significantly reduced when the inhibitors were used. Through inhibition of the proteasome, we also show that the production of H2O2 and the cell death events mediated by mitochondria are regulated by proteosomal activities in DEX-induced thymocyte apoptosis. We conclude that in DEX-treated thymocytes, the increased production of H2O2 originates from mitochondria and is proapoptotic for cell death mediated by mitochondria. We also conclude that all the apoptotic events mediated by mitochondria are regulated by proteasomes."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"The hypothesis that prolactin PRL functions as an immunomodulator was based on studies showing lymphocyte PRL receptors, and its effects on growth, differentiation, and apoptosis in lymphoid cells. However, studies of PRL PRL-/- and PRL receptor knockout mice indicated that PRL was not required for immune system development or function under basal conditions. Because PRL maintains survival in glucocorticoid GC-treated Nb2-T lymphocytes in vitro, and PRL and GCs are elevated during stress, we investigated whether PRL protected T cells in vivo from GC-induced apoptosis. Adrenalectomized mice PRL -/-, undetectable PRL pituitary grafted PRL-/- PRL-/-Graft, elevated PRL and PRL/-, normal PRL were treated with dexamethasone DEX or PBS. Thymocytes and splenocytes were isolated and annexin V labeling of phosphatidylserine, DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3 activation were assessed as indices of apoptosis. Total thymocytes and CD4 and CD8 T cells obtained from DEX-treated PRL-/- mice exhibited significantly increased annexin V binding. In contrast, binding was not altered by DEX in PRL-/-Graft thymocytes. In addition, DEX induced classic DNA fragmentation in PRL-/- thymocytes. Elevated serum PRL reduced this effect. Thymocytes from DEX-treated PRL-/- mice exhibited increased caspase-3 activation, which was inhibited in cells from PRL-/-Graft mice. Finally, elevated expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, XIAP, was observed in thymi from DEX-treated PRL -/-Graft mice. This is the first demonstration that elevated PRL antagonizes apoptosis in thymocytes exposed to GCs in vivo. These observations suggest that, under conditions of increased GCs, such as during stress, elevated PRL functions physiologically to maintain survival and function of T-lymphocytes."
Dexamethasone,caspase-3 activation,"c-Fos is a transcription factor that promotes cell growth, differentiation, and transformation. We found that c-Fos was degraded when WEHI7.2 mouse lymphoma cells were induced to undergo apoptosis with the calcium ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, or the glucocorticoid hormone, dexamethasone. The degradation of c-Fos preceded caspase-3 activation and apoptotic nuclear chromatin condensation and was inhibited by the proteasome inhibitors MG132, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal, and lactacystin. Stable transfection of WEHI7.2 cells with a mutant form of c-Fos that was not degraded by the proteasome inhibited apoptosis. Also, overexpression of Bcl-2 in WEHI7.2 cells blocked c-Fos degradation and inhibited apoptosis. The results indicate that proteasome-mediated degradation of c-Fos is an early, Bcl-2-regulated step in apoptosis induction by thapsigargin and dexamethasone. These findings suggest that c-Fos may have a protective action that is eliminated by proteasome-mediated degradation and preserved by Bcl-2."
Dexamethasone,COX-2 inhibition,"Inducible cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2, but not constitutive COX-1, can be upregulated in rheumatoid synovial tissue by interleukin-1 beta and phorbol esters and is inhibited by dexamethasone. This supports the role of COX-2 in acute inflammation in arthritis. Selective inhibition of COX-2 by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs has been proposed as an approach to reduce their associated side effects while maintaining efficacy. The improved safety profile of selective COX-2 inhibitors will allow more widespread and sustained use than is currently possible with standard NSAIDs. In rheumatoid arthritis they may be used as effective symptomatic relief, in combination with disease modifying therapy at an early stage of disease. In osteoarthritis, and, more particularly, soft tissue rheumatism, pain contributes to the development of chronic disease, therefore the main benefit of selective COX-2 inhibition will be to provide safe, effective pain relief to maintain mobility and reduce disability."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a peptide shuttle in delivering diclofenac into and through human epidermis. Diclofenac was conjugated to a novel phenylalanyl-N-methyl-naphthalenylalanine-derived diketopiperazine DKP shuttle and to TAT a classical cell penetrating peptide, and topically applied to human epidermis in vitro. DKP and TAT effectively permeated into and through human epidermis. When conjugated to diclofenac, both DKP and TAT enhanced delivery into and through human epidermis, though DKP was significantly more effective. Penetration of diclofenac through human epidermis to receptor was increased by conjugation to the peptide shuttle and cell penetrating peptide with enhancement of 6x by DKP-diclofenac and 3x by TAT-diclofenac. In addition, the amount of diclofenac retained within the epidermis was significantly increased by peptide conjugation. COX-2 inhibition activity of diclofenac was retained when conjugated to DKP. Our study suggests that the peptide shuttle approach may offer a new strategy for targeted delivery of small therapeutic and diagnostic molecules to the skin."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"Diclofenac is the most widely prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug worldwide. Data collected during the last 10 years reported a dose-duration dependent increasing of cardiovascular risk associated with the use of diclofenac, supporting the evidence of a close association with the degree of COX-2 inhibition achieved in vivo. Nevertheless, the amplitude of cardiovascular risk associated with the administration of diclofenac at low doses and for the short-term duration is still poorly defined. Indeed, data did not show a clear and strong increasing of the risk for daily doses of 75 and of 50 mg. Concerning duration, while the identification of a safe temporal window is less defined, some studies reported an absence or a very low risk when the exposure is shorter than 30 days. Today, new low-dosage diclofenac formulations are available, allowing to reduce the systemic exposure, the degree of COX-2 inhibition and possibly the risk of occurrence of cardiovascular events. This is the reason why those new formulations may represent the ideal drug for the management of pain in the emergency setting."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs and the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine CSA are concurrently administered in arthritis. Here, we investigated whether diclofenac non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-1 and 2, COX-1/COX-2, celecoxib selective COX-2 inhibitor or SC560 selective COX-1 inhibitor interact variably with haemodynamic effects of CSA in conscious female rats. Changes caused by CSA 10 mg/kg i.v. in blood pressure BP, heart rate HR, HR variability HRV and myocardial contractility were assessed in the absence and presence of individual NSAIDs 10 mg/kg each. Compared with vehicle values, CSA caused immediate and sustained i increases in BP and decreases in pulse pressure index PPI and HR, ii elevations in left ventricular LV contractility dP/dtmax and isovolumic relaxation constant au and iii increases in the time- and frequency-domain indices of HRV and shifted the cardiac sympathovagal balance towards parasympathetic dominance. CSA hypertension was abolished in rats pre-treated with celecoxib and intensified in the presence of diclofenac or SC560. Alternatively, the CSA-evoked decreases in PPI, increases in HRV indices and cardiac parasympathetic dominance were blunted by celecoxib in contrast to no effect for diclofenac or SC560. Similarly, celecoxib, but not other NSAIDs, eliminated the elevated LV contractility dP/dtmax and isovolumic relaxation constant au, , which reflect cardiac systolic and diastolic function, respectively, that accompanied the CSA-induced pressure load. The data underscore the preferential capacity of selective COX-2 inhibition by celecoxib to mitigate CSA hypertension and consequent alterations in cardiac performance and autonomic balance. By contrast, CSA effects are preserved or even exacerbated after COX-1 inhibition."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"Two series of benzodioxole-pyrazole hybrids were synthesized and the IC50 values for in vitro inhibition of the enzymes cyclooxygenase 1/2 COX-1, COX-2 and 5-lipoxygenase 5-LOX were investigated. All compounds were tested for their in vivo anti-inflammatory and analgesic potentials using diclofenac sodium as a reference standard. Compounds 4, 11, 17, 20, 21, 26, and 27, which showed good analgesic and/or anti-inflammatory activities, were also evaluated for their ability to inhibit tumor necrosis factor TNF- production, myeloperoxidase and proteinase, beside their antioxidant activity. Collectively, compounds 11, 17, and 26 displayed significant anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antioxidant activities, beside dual COX-2 and 5-LOX inhibition. Among these, compound 26 showed high selectivity for in vitro COX-1/COX-2 inhibition, whereas the analogs 11 and 17 noticeably ameliorated the TNF- level by 85.19 and 97.71, respectively. A molecular docking study was performed to investigate the possible binding mode of compounds 11, 17, and 26 with the active sites of the COX-2 and 5-LOX enzymes, where they showed nearly the same binding pattern as that of celecoxib and meclofenamic acid, respectively."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"Because cyclooxygenases COX convert arachidonic acid into pro-inflammatory cyclic endoperoxides, inhibition of these enzymes and especially the inducible COX-2 form is an important therapeutic approach to manage inflammatory diseases and possibly prevent cancer. Due to side effects of existing non-selective and COX-2 selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, the discovery of new COX inhibitors continues to be an area of active investigation. Since existing assays are slow or lack specificity, a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry LC-MS-MS based COX inhibition assay was developed and validated for the rapid and accurate quantitative analysis of the COX product prostaglandin E2. The assay was validated using four COX inhibitors, celecoxib, indomethacin, resveratrol, and diclofenac that exhibit different selectivities towards COX-1 and COX-2. The IC50 values of celecoxib and resveratrol for ovine and human COX-2 were compared, and the Km values were determined. Since considerable inter-species variation was observed, human COX-2 should be used for the discovery of COX inhibitors intended for human use. This sensitive and accurate LC-MS-MS based assay is suitable for the rapid screening of ligands for COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition and for IC50 determinations."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"The discovery of two cyclooxygenase COX-isoenzymes, a constitutive COX-1, serving homeostatic prostanoid synthesis, and an inducible COX-2, responsible for proinflammatory prostanoid production, led to the development of new non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs, the selective COX-2 inhibitors, promising minimal NSAID-typical toxicity with full anti-inflammatory efficacy. So far, the strategy of selective COX-2 inhibition has been successful. Selective COX-2 inhibitors have significantly less gastrotoxicity and no effects on platelet aggregation. However, with regard to renal adverse events, selective COX-2 inhibitors do not offer a clinically relevant advantage over non-selective inhibitors. Moreover, concerns over the cardiovascular risk of selective COX-2 inhibitors have recently been raised. The second generation of COX-2 inhibitors with higher COX-2 selectivity was developed with the promise of further reduction of NSAID-typical adverse effects. The leading compounds are valdecoxib, parecoxib, etoricoxib and lumaricoxib. At the present time they have proven efficacy for the treatment of pain and inflammation. Parecoxib as a parenteral, highly selective COX-2 inhibitor has the potential to become the NSAID of choice for treatment of postoperative pain. In clinical trials, valdecoxib, parecoxib, etoricoxib and lumaricoxib have caused no more endoscopic ulcers than placebo. However, to date, no data on the clinically relevant endpoints perforation, symptomatic ulcer and bleeding are available. Furthermore, no definite conclusions on renal and cardiovascular safety are possible. Current evidence points to a marginal, if any, gain of safety compared with the first generation of COX-2 inhibitors. However, trials with the new COX-2 inhibitors offer the chance to address these open questions of highly selective COX-2 inhibition that is, thrombogenic risk, sodium and water retention, and interference with tissue repair, in particular, healing of mucosal damage."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"BACKGROUND A review of the scientific literature suggested the occurrence of low-level incidences of ventricular septal defect VSD and midline defect MD in rat fetuses and diaphragmatic hernia DH, VSD, and MD in rabbit fetuses after maternal exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs. Aspirin, an NSAID that irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase 1 COX-1 and COX-2, induces DH, VSD, and MD when administered as one dose during the sensitive periods of development in rats. Unlike aspirin, other NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, reversibly inhibit COX activity. To evaluate whether the dysmorphogenesis observed after maternal NSAID exposure correlates with COX-1 or COX-2 inhibition, a series of compounds with different capacities to inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 were administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the sensitive period for heart development and midline closure.   METHODS The compounds selected, ranked from the most COX-2 selective to the most COX-1 selective based onCOX inhibition in a human whole blood assay, were CJ-19,209, meloxicam, diclofenac, diflunisal, ibuprofen, and ketorolac. Rat dams were treated on gestation days GDs 9 and 10, and rabbit does were treated on GDs 9, 10, and 11. The doses selected for evaluation represented the maximum tolerable dose for the compound, with the exception of CJ-19,209, which was dosed at 1000 mg/kg. Fetuses were collected by cesarean section on GDs 21 and 29 for rats and rabbits, respectively, and all fetuses were examined for external and visceral developmental anomalies.   RESULTS In rabbits, diflunisal induced DH, VSD, and MD omphalocele and single incidences of VSD and MD gastroschisis were noted in the ibuprofen group no other developmental findings were associated with treatment. In rats, ibuprofen, diflunisal, and ketorolac induced increases in the incidence of VSD. In general the induction of developmental defects was associated with compounds that selectively inhibit COX-1 or have a high ratio of COX-1 to COX-2 inhibition.   CONCLUSIONS Inhibition of COX-1 may be involved in the disruption of heart development, whereas the selective inhibition of COX-2 as assessed with CJ-19,209 appears to have no effect on heart development and midline closure in rats and rabbits."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"Four series of new bipyrazoles comprising the N-phenylpyrazole scaffold linked to polysubstituted pyrazoles or to antipyrine moiety through different amide linkages were synthesized. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities. In vitro COX-1/COX-2 inhibition study revealed that compound 16b possessed the lowest IC50 value against both COX-1 and COX-2. Moreover, the effect of the most promising compounds on inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS and cyclooxygenase COX-2 protein expression in lipopolysaccharide LPS-activated rat monocytes was also investigated. The results revealed that some of the synthesized compounds showed anti-inflammatory and/or analgesic activity with less ulcerogenic potential than the reference drug diclofenac sodium and are well tolerated by experimental animals. Moreover, they significantly inhibited iNOS and COX-2 protein expression induced by LPS stimulation. Compounds 16b and 18 were proved to display anti-inflammatory activity superior to diclofenac sodium and analgesic activity equivalent to it with minimal ulcerogenic potential."
Diclofenac,caspase-3 activation,"Diclofenac DCLF is a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that is associated with idiosyncratic, drug-induced liver injury IDILI in humans. The mechanisms of DCLF-induced liver injury are unknown however, patients with certain inflammatory diseases have an increased risk of developing IDILI, which raises the possibility that immune mediators play a role in the pathogenesis. DCLF synergizes with the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha TNF and interferon-gamma IFN to cause hepatocellular apoptosis in vitro by a mechanism that involves activation of the endoplasmic reticulum ER stress response pathway and of the mitogen-activated protein kinases, c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK. DCLF also causes an increase in intracellular calcium Ca in hepatocytes, but the role of this in the cytotoxic synergy between DCLF and cytokines is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that Ca contributes to DCLF/cytokine-induced cytotoxic synergy. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DCLF led to an increase in intracellular Ca at 6 and 12 h, and this response was augmented in the presence of TNF and IFN at 12 h. The intracellular Ca chelator BAPTA/AM reduced cytotoxicity and caspase-3 activation caused by DCLF/cytokine cotreatment. BAPTA/AM also significantly reduced DCLF-induced activation of the ER stress sensor, protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase PERK, as well as activation of JNK and ERK. Treatment of cells with an inositol trisphosphate receptor antagonist almost completely eliminated DCLF/cytokine-induced cytotoxicity and decreased DCLF-induced activation of PERK, JNK, and ERK. These findings indicate that Ca contributes to DCLF/cytokine-induced cytotoxic synergy by promoting activation of the ER stress-response pathway and JNK and ERK."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"Diclofenac is a non-steroidal antinflammatory drug NSAID that finds indication in the treatment of debilitating pathologies characterized by chronic pain sustained by inflammation, such as in rheumatic disease rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis or periarthritis, bursitis, tendonitis, myositis and sciatica. Its properties differentiate it from other NSAIDs. In fact, diclofenacs increased effect on spinal nociception and chronic neuro-inflammatory pain may be referred to 1 its synergistic effects on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- PPAR-  activation and prostaglandin synthesis inhibition COX-2 inhibition 2 its capacity of suppressing neuronal hyperexcitability through the blockage of neuronal K channels in a concentration-dependant manner and 3 its facility to cross the blood-brain barrier."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"Two novel series derived from nicotinic acid were synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory activity against cyclooxygenases COX-1 and COX-2, and their selectivity indices were determined. Celecoxib, diclofenac and indomethacin were used as reference drugs. All compounds showed highly potent COX-2 inhibitory activity and higher selectivity towards COX-2 inhibition compared to indomethacin. In addition, these compounds except 3a showed clear preferential COX-2 over COX-1 inhibition compared to diclofenac. Compounds 3b, 3e, 4c and 4f showed COX-2 inhibitory activity equipotent to celecoxib. Compounds 4c and 4f demonstrated selectivity indices 1.8-1.9 fold higher than celecoxib. These two most potent and COX-2 selective compounds were further tested in vivo for anti-inflammatory activity by means of carrageenan induced rat paw edema method. Ulcerogenic activity with histopathological studies were performed. The results showed no ulceration, which implies their safe gastric profile. Compound 4f exhibited the most potent in vivo anti-inflammatory activity comparable to all reference drugs. Further, compounds 4c and 4f were investigated for their influence on certain inflammatory cytokines TNF- and IL-1 in addition to PEG2. The findings revealed that these candidates could be identified as promising potent anti-inflammatory agents. Molecular docking of 4c and 4f in the COX-2 active site was performed to rationalize their COX-2 inhibitory potency. The results were found to be in line with the biological findings as they exerted more favorable interactions compared to that of celecoxib, explaining their remarkable COX-2 inhibitory activity."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"Novel pyrazolyl 2-hydroxychalcone derivatives 3a-e and pyrazolylpyrazoline derivatives 4a-e and 5a-j derived from the naturally existing furochromone Khellin were synthesized and evaluated for their in vivo anti-inflammatory activity. Most of the synthesized compounds showed better or comparable activity to that of Diclofenac as reference drug. Twelve compounds were evaluated for their ulcerogenic potential and exhibited no ulcerogenic effect. In addition compounds 3c, 5c and 5h as examples showed PGE2 inhibition  88.86, 65.87 and 44.06, respectively and TNF inhibition  48.62, 31.11 and 16.02, respectively in rat serum samples. Compounds 3c, 5c, 5h and Celecoxib were subjected to in vitro COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition assay, showed selectivity index 45.04, 102.04, 131.58 and 185.18, respectively. The computational finding supported those of in vitro, where the pyrazolylpyrazolines interacted with the COX-2 enzyme in a similar orientation to that of Celecoxib, while chlacones were found to exhibit similar orientation to that of Diclofenac."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"Non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs are frequently used to treat pain, fever, and inflammation. Historically, NSAIDs have been categorized as traditional NSAIDs and newer cyclooxygenase COX-2 inhibitors coxibs. However, traditional NSAIDs also inhibit the COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme isoforms to a varying degree. This diversity of COX-1 and COX-2 selectivity within the class of traditional NSAIDs has proven clinically important, with evidence accumulating on the cardiovascular risks associated with selective COX-2 inhibition. Thus, the relative COX-2 selectivity of traditional NSAIDs correlates with their cardiovascular risk profile, being more favourable for non-selective NSAIDs, such as naproxen and low-dose ibuprofen, and less favourable for more COX-2 selective agents, such as diclofenac. To enhance clinically relevant terminology, we advocate categorizing all non-aspirin NSAIDs-including traditional NSAIDs-according to their relative COX-1 and COX-2 selectivity as either COX-1 inhibitors, non-selective NSAIDs, or COX-2 inhibitors. We further recommend subcategorizing COX-2 inhibitors as newer COX-2 inhibitors coxibs or older COX-2 inhibitors. Finally, we recommend examining the effects of the individual NSAIDs included in each of the proposed categories. Adhering to these recommendations will align future studies, advance interpretation of COX-specific adverse cardiovascular effects, and provide better guidance to clinicians prescribing NSAIDs."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"PURPOSE Once daily doses of 100-400 mg lumiracoxib have been proposed to inhibit local prostaglandin synthesis longer than systemic prostaglandin synthesis due to local accumulation in inflamed, acidic tissue. Lower, less toxic doses, however, might still achieve the clinical goal and merit further contemplation.   METHODS In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way cross-over study, 18 healthy men received, with an interval of 24 h, two oral doses of 50 mg lumiracoxib or for comparison, 90 mg etoricoxib, for which local tissue accumulation has not been claimed as therapeutic component. Systemic and local drug concentrations, assessed by means of subcutaneous in-vivo microdialysis, were related to COX-2 inhibiting effects, quantified as inhibition of prostaglandin ex-vivo production in whole blood as well as local tissue prostaglandin PG concentrations.   RESULTS Twenty-four hours after the first dose, only etoricoxib was detectable in plasma and inhibited PGE2 production. In contrast, after the second dose, systemic PGE2 concentrations were significantly reduced by both coxibs, indicating similar maximum systemic effects of the selected doses. The local COX-2 inhibition by etoricoxib was most pronounced for PGD2. To the contrary, no indication was given of local inhibition of PG production by lumiracoxib at the dose tested.   CONCLUSIONS Doses of 50 mg lumiracoxib and 90 mg etoricoxib produced similar maximum inhibition of systemic COX-2 function whereas 50 mg lumiracoxib was ineffective in producing local COX-2 inhibition. At a 50 mg dosage, lumiracoxib does not provide peripheral effects that outlast its systemic actions in therapies of rheumatic diseases such as osteoarthritis."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories NSAIDs are among the most commonly used drugs in clinical practice. They block cyclooxygenases COX enzymes, but the degree of inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 varies between them. In general, NSAIDs are classified in selective COX-2 or coxibs and non-selective or traditional NSAIDs. Both the analgesic and antiinflammatory effects, as well as the cardiovascular adverse effects, depend on the COX-2 inhibition. This paper reviews the available evidence of the increased risk of thrombotic events for both coxibs and traditional NSAID. The prothrombotic effect could be due to the inhibition of endothelial COX-2, with a decrease in production of prostacyclin and a relative increase in platelet thromboxane levels. Coxibs and diclofenac 150 mg/day seem to increase the risk of major vascular events by more than a third. Ibuprofen 2400 mg/day could slightly increase the risk of coronary events. Naproxen 1000 mg/day apparently does not increase the risk of vascular events. Besides ibuprofen and naproxen have the potential to decrease the cardioprotective effect of low doses of aspirin. Naproxen = 1000 mg/day and low doses of ibuprofen = 1200 mg/day are considered to have the most favorable thrombotic cardiovascular safety profiles of all NSAIDs. Therapeutic decisions should be based on an assessment of a persons individual risk factors, using the safest NSAIDs, at the lowest effective doses, for the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms, restricting their use in patients with increased cardiovascular risk."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"New thiophene and annulated thiophene pyrazole hybrids were synthesized and screened for their in vitro COX-1/COX-2 enzymatic inhibition and in vivo anti-inflammatory activities. All compounds were more COX-2 selective inhibitors than COX-1 with compound 13 exhibiting the highest COX-2 selectivity index. Compounds 3, 6a, 9 and 11 were the most promising in the acute anti-inflammatory assay while compounds 3, 5, 6a, 6c, 9, 10, 11 and 13 exerted promising anti-inflammatory activity in the sub-acute anti-inflammatory assay. Compounds 3, 6a, 6c, 9, 10 and 11 were evaluated for their ED50 values and were more potent than diclofenac sodium while compounds 6a, 6c and 9 were of greater potency than celecoxib with compound 6a being the most potent showing ED50 = 0.033 mmol/kg. These compounds were non-toxic and proved to be gastrointestinal safe compared to indomethacin, diclofenac sodium and celecoxib. Docking studies into COX-2 active site PDB code 3LN1 revealed that compounds 3, 6a, 6c, 9, 10, 11 and 13 had binding modes and energies comparable to that of celecoxib. Compounds 3, 9, 10 and 11 complied with Lipinskis RO5 while compounds 6a and 6c showed one violation whereas compound 13 deviated by 2 violations. Compounds 6a, 6c and 13 showed 100 plasma protein binding PPB and showed no aqueous solubility while compounds 3, 10 and 11 demonstrated the best drug likeness model scores. Therefore, the thiophene analog 3 and the thienopyrimidine derivatives 10 and 11 are promising anti-inflammatory candidates that exert moderate selective COX-2 inhibition with acceptable physicochemical properties."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"Traumatic brain injury TBI is followed by a secondary inflammation in the brain. The inflammatory response includes prostanoid synthesis by the inducible enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2. Inhibition of COX-2 is associated with improved functional outcome in experimental TBI models, although central nervous system-specific effects are not fully understood. Animal studies report better outcomes in females than males. The exact mechanisms for this gender dichotomy remain unknown. In an initial study we reported increased COX-2 expression in male rats, compared to female, following experimental TBI. It is possible that COX-2 induction is directly associated with increased cell death after TBI. Therefore, we designed a sequential study to investigate the blocking of COX-2 specifically, using the established COX-2 inhibitor diclofenac. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 250 and 350 g were exposed to focal penetrating TBI and randomly selected for diclofenac treatment 5 g intralesionally, immediately following TBI n = 8, controls n = 8, sham operation n = 8, and normal no manipulation n = 4. After 24 h, brains were removed, fresh frozen, cut into 14 m coronal sections and subjected to COX-2 immunofluorescence, Fluoro Jade, TUNEL, and lesion area analyses. Diclofenac treatment decreased TUNEL staining indicative of apoptosis with a mean change of 54 p lt 0.05 and lesion area with a mean change of 55 p lt 0.005. Neuronal degeneration measured by Fluoro Jade and COX-2 protein expression levels were not affected. In conclusion, COX-2 inhibition by diclofenac was associated with decreased apoptosis and lesion area after focal penetrating TBI and may be of interest for further studies of clinical applications."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer. However, evidence is accumulating that NSAIDs have anti-cancer effects in addition to inhibiting cyclooxygenase COX-mediated prostanoid biosynthesis. We now show that indomethacin, a popular NSAID, significantly reduced the 3H-arachidonic acid uptake in HCA-7 human colon cancer cells. Interestingly, no decrease in the uptake of 3H-arachidonic acid occurred when the cells were treated with aspirin, diclofenac, and sulindac even though the concentrations of these NSAIDs were high enough to inhibit COX-2 activity. These findings suggest that indomethacin has a novel anti-cancer effect that may be independent of COX-2 inhibition."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"We investigated the contribution of cyclo-oxygenase enzyme inhibition and prostamide agonism on human colonic contractility in vitro. The effects of the non-specific COX inhibitor diclofenac were compared against selective COX-2 inhibition via nimesulide, the prostanoid EP1 receptor antagonist SC19220 or the prostaglandin prodrug/prostamide receptor agonist bimatoprost, on potency of contraction to acetylcholine in human colonic circular and longitudinal muscle strips. Pre-treatment with either nimesulide 10-5M or diclofenac 10-6M caused a significant decrease in the potency of acetylcholine-evoked longitudinal muscle contraction, but did not inhibit acetylcholine-evoked circular muscle contraction. Pre-treatment with the EP1 receptor antagonist SC19220 10-5M similarly decreased cholinergic potency in longitudinal muscle, without influence on circular muscle contraction. The prostamide agonist bimatoprost 10-6M increased basal circular and longitudinal muscle tone, but did not alter cholinergic potency in either muscle layer. In conclusion, colonic longitudinal muscle contraction is augmented by COX-2 activity, most likely via PGE2 acting at EP1 receptors. While colonic contraction is tonically modulated by bimatoprost, it does not share the same functional properties attributed to other endogenous COX-2 metabolites on colonic contractile function."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"In addition to the upper GI tract, NSAIDs can damage the small bowel and the colon. NSAID enteropathy is frequent and may be present in more than 60 of patients taking these drugs long term. In most cases, damage is subclinical, including increased mucosal permeability, inflammation, erosions, ulceration, but other more serious clinical outcomes such as anemia, and overall bleeding, perforation, obstruction, diverticulitis and deaths have also been described. The magnitude of these serious outcomes from the lower GI tract is not well defined, but recent data suggest that they may be as frequent and severe as upper GI complications. Contrary to what happens in the upper GI tract, treatment and prevention of NSAID enteropathy is difficult, since the pathogenic mechanisms are different and not well understood. Among other options, misoprostol, antibiotics, and sulphasalazine have been proved to be effective in animal models, but they have not been properly tested in humans. Selective COX-2 inhibition is emerging as a potential alternative to tNSAIDs in the prevention of damage in the lower GI tract in rheumatologic patients. Preliminary studies in healthy volunteers have shown that these drugs are associated with no or less small bowel damage than tNSAIDs plus PPI, although their long-term effects in patients need to be properly tested. Post hoc analysis of previous outcome studies focused on complications of upper GI tract or cardiovascular events have shown contradictory results. Data from one ongoing trial comparing celecoxib versus diclofenac plus PPI and examining serious outcomes from the whole GI tract will probably provide new insights in this area."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"AIMS The hypertensive effect of the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine CSA is paralleled, and probably triggered, by impaired arterial baroreceptor sensitivity BRS. Here we asked if these effects of CSA are influenced by co-administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs and if the oxidative NADPH-oxidase NADPHox/Rho-kinase ROCK pathway mediates this interaction.   MATERIALS AND METHODS Female rats were treated for 10days with CSA 25mg/kg/day, diclofenac DIC, COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor, 1mg/kg/day, celecoxib COX-2 inhibitor, 10mg/kg/day, or their combinations. Baroreflex curves relating changes in heart rate HR to increases or decreases in blood pressure BP evoked by phenylephrine PE and sodium nitroprusside SNP, respectively, were constructed and slopes of the curves were taken as measures of BRS.   KEY FINDINGS Compared with control rats, CSA increased BP and reduced reflex chronotropic responses as indicated by the significantly smaller BRSPE and BRSSNP values. Similar effects were observed in rats treated with diclofenac alone or combined with CSA. Whereas CSA hypertension was maintained after selective COX-2 inhibition by celecoxib, the concomitant BRS reductions were largely eliminated. NADPHox inhibition by diphenyleneiodonium DPI blunted the CSA/DIC-evoked increases and decreases in BP and BRSPE, respectively. By contrast, fasudil ROCK inhibitor had no effect on CSA/DIC hypertension but reversed the associated reductions in both BRSPE and BRSSNP.   SIGNIFICANCE Depending on the nature of the cardiovascular response, NADPHox and ROCK contribute variably to the worsened cardiovascular profile in CSA/DIC-treated rats. Further, celecoxib rather than diclofenac could be a better choice as an add-on therapy to CSA in autoimmune arthritic conditions."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"OBJECTIVES In the present study, we investigated the potential anti-nociceptive activity and acute anti-inflammatory effect of a synthetic quinoline compound 2-4-Methoxyphenylbenzohquinoline-4-carboxylic acid, QC, possessing structural elements of both naproxen and tomoxiprole drugs.   MATERIALS AND METHODS The anti-nociceptive activity of QC was evaluated using chemical- and thermal-induced nociception models and its acute anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated by xylene-induced ear edema test in mice.   RESULTS QC displayed a dose dependent effect in both acute anti-nociceptive tests writhing and hot plate. This compound at dose of 6.562 mg/kg showed a high anti-nociceptive effect near equal to diclofenac 5 mg/kg. It also showed high anti-inflammatory effects less than 6.562 mg/kg comparable to those of reference drugs diclofenac 5 mg/kg and celecoxib 100 mg/kg. Docking study showed that this quinoline derivative could inhibit COX-2 enzyme strongly.   CONCLUSION QC showed high anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects comparable to reference drugs and can exert its anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities through COX-2 inhibition."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"Click chemistry was used to synthesize a new series of thioquinazolinone molecules equipped with propargyl moiety,1,2,3-triazolyl and isoxazolyl rings. Our design was based on merging pharmacophores previously reported to exhibit COX-2 inhibitory activities to a thioquinazolinone-privileged scaffold. The synthesized compounds were subjected to in vitro cyclooxygenase COX-1/COX-2 and 15-LOX inhibition assays. Compounds 2c, 3b, 3h, 3j, and 3k showed COX-2 inhibition with IC50 M 0.18, 0.19, 0.11, 0.16 and 0.17 respectively. These values were compared to celecoxib IC50 0.05 M, diclofenac IC50 0.8 M and indomethacin IC50 0.49 M reference drugs. They also showed 15-LOX inhibition with IC50 M 6.21, 4.33, 7.62, 5.21 and 3.98 respectively. These values were compared with Zileuton IC50 2.41 M and Meclofenamate sodium IC50 5.64 M as positive controls. These compounds were further challenged by PMA-induced THP-1 differentiation assay where compounds 2c and 3j inhibited monocyte to macrophage differentiation efficiently with IC50 values of 4.78 M and 5.63 M, respectively, compared to that of diclofenac sodium 4.86 M. On the other hand, 3h demonstrated a significantly increased potency compared to diclofenac in this assay IC50 = 0.13 M. The same compounds exhibited significant in vivo anti-inflammatory effect as indicated by the formalin-induced rat-paw edema test. Docking experiments of compounds 2c, 3b, 3h, 3j, and 3k into COX-2 binding pocket have been conducted, where strong binding interactions have been identified and effective overall docking scores have been recorded. Their drug-likeness has been assessed using Molinspiration, Molsoft and Pre-ADMET software products."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"The role of lymphatic vessels in myocarditis is largely unknown, while it has been shown to play a key role in other inflammatory diseases. We aimed to investigate the role of lymphatic vessels in myocarditis using in vivo model induced with Theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus TMEV and in vitro model with rat cardiac lymphatic muscle cells RCLMC. In the TMEV model, we found that upregulation of a set of inflammatory mediator genes, including interleukin IL-1, tumor necrosis factor TNF-and COX-2 were associated with disease activity. Thus, using in vitro collagen gel contraction assays, we decided to clarify the roles of these mediators by testing contractility of RCLMC in response to IL-1 and TNF- individually and in combination, in the presence or absence of IL-1 receptor antagonist Anakinra cyclooxygenase COX inhibitors inhibitors TFAP, diclofenac and DuP-697. IL-1 impaired RCLMC contractility dose-dependently, while co-incubation with both IL-1 and TNF- exhibited synergistic effects in decreasing RCLMC contractility with increased COX-2 expression. Anakinra maintained RCLMC contractility Anakinra blocked the mobilization of COX-2 induced by IL-1 with or without TNF-. COX-2 inhibition blocked the IL-1-mediated decrease in RCLMC contractility. Mechanistically, we found that IL-1 increased prostaglandin PG E2 release dose-dependently, while Anakinra blocked IL-1 mediated PGE2 release. Using prostaglandin E receptor 4 EP4 receptor antagonist, we demonstrated that EP4 receptor blockade maintained RCLMC contractility following IL-1 exposure. Our results indicate that IL-1 reduces RCLMC contractility via COX-2/PGE2 signaling with synergistic cooperation by TNF-. These pathways may help provoke inflammatory mediator accumulation within the heart, driving progression from acute myocarditis into dilated cardiomyopathy."
Diclofenac,Cyclooxygenase inhibition,"AVP10-8-10-6M increased ACTH as well as PGE2 release from rat anterior pituitary quarters in vitro in a concentration dependent manner. IBMX 0.1 mM, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, increased the ACTH response to AVP. The cAMP content in pituitary tissue was increased by AVP. Cyclooxygenase inhibition by indomethacin1.4 X 10-5 M or diclofenac 1.8 X 10-5M led to a potentiation of AVP-evoked ACTH secretion and to a decrease in AVP-stimulated cAMP formation. PGE210-6M significantly increased pituitary cAMP content and indomethacin did not affect cAMP levels activated by PGE2. PGE2 attenuated the AVP-induced ACTH release. These results indicate that at least two functional compartments of AVP-activated cAMP responses are involved in the AVP-induced ACTH release. One compartment is directly activated by AVP and participates in the propagation of AVP-induced ACTH release. The second compartment is activated by PGE2. The contribution of the second compartment to the regulation of ACTH secretion is not well understood since PGE2 shows an inhibitory effect on AVP-induced ACTH secretion."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"A series of 4,5-dihydro-1,5-diaryl-1H-pyrazole-3-substituted-heteroazoles were designed and synthesized in order to obtain new compounds with potential anti-inflammatory activity. The title compounds were screened for in vivo anti-inflammatory activity by using Carrageenan induced rat paw edema method. Diclofenac sodium was used as a standard drug for comparison. Out of the 30 compounds tested, compound 19a, 19b, 25a, 25b exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activity. Selected compounds were also screened for in vitro COX-2 inhibition assay and analgesic activity in the acetic acid induced writhing model."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"BACKGROUND Diclofenac sodium 3 gel Solaraze gained US approval for the treatment of actinic keratosis AK more than 10 years ago. Since the publication of the pivotal phase 3 studies, numerous clinical studies have assessed use of this therapy in a variety of body areas, special populations, and novel combinations.   OBJECTIVE To provide a comprehensive update on clinical data and research on the use of diclofenac sodium 3 gel in AK.   METHODS Review of the literature.   RESULTS Accumulating evidence from preclinical research supports that the proposed mechanism of diclofenac sodium 3 gel may include cyclo-oxgenase 2 COX-2 inhibition, inhibition of angiogenesis, and induction of apoptosis. A literature review identified 17 publications beyond the 2 pivotal studies on the use of diclofenac sodium 3 gel for AK. A phase 4 open-label study reported that 58 percent of patients achieved complete clearance of target lesions at the 30-day post-treatment assessment among patients who were evaluable at 1-year post-treatment, sustained long-term clearance of AK lesions was observed. Active comparator studies demonstrated comparable efficacy of diclofenac sodium 3 gel with 5-fluorouracil 5 and imiquimod 5. Publications on the efficacy of diclofenac sodium 3 gel for AK of the lip report complete clearance rates comparable to those reported for other body areas. Diclofenac sodium 3 gel has also demonstrated efficacy for clearing AK lesions in immunosuppressed populations. Sequential use of diclofenac sodium 3 gel with cryosurgery or photodynamic therapy has been investigated and may emerge as a useful approach for some patients.   CONCLUSIONS Diclofenac sodium 3 gel has a unique proposed mechanism of action in AK that may involve COX-2 inhibition, inhibition of angiogenesis, and induction of apoptosis. In the past decade, numerous clinical studies have demonstrated this topical therapy to be effective and well tolerated for the treatment of AK."
Diclofenac,Cyclooxygenase inhibition,"Since renal prostaglandins may contribute to natriuresis induced by endogenous atrial natriuretic factor ANF, acute volume expansion AVL, a known stimulus of ANF and prostaglandins, was induced in 8 healthy women in order to test whether the consequent sodium and water diuresis is altered by prostaglandin inhibition. AVL i.v. infusion of a 2 liter 5 glucose solution in 1 h was infused after placebo and after inhibition of prostaglandins with diclofenac 200 mg/day orally for 4 days, in a double blind randomized cross-over fashion. Urinary eicosanoids PGE2, PGF2 alpha, 6-ketoPGF1 alpha, TXB2--RIA, plasma ANF RIA and urinary electrolytes were determined before, during and after AVL under both placebo and diclofenac regimes. During placebo, AVL induced sustained increases in plasma ANF 174 at peak, p less than 0.001 ANOVA, excretion of the four eicosanoids 149-1172, p less than 0.005-0.001, urinary volume UV, 815, p less than 0.001, natriuresis UNa, 98, p less than 0.005 and in kaliuresis UK, 90, p less than 0.001. Cyclooxygenase inhibition resulted in a reduction of over 70 in both baseline values and AVL-induced increase of eicosanoids. It did not alter either baseline levels or AVL-stimulated ANF, UV, UNa and UK in relation to placebo. The present results suggest that the diuretic and natriuretic activity of ANF is not mediated by renal PGs in humans."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"The medicinal activity of COX-2 inhibitors are sufficiently beneficial to urge the search for new drug designs. This study presents 16 analogs of lumiracoxib and 10 analogs to valdecoxib having properties suitable as COX-2 inhibitors. For lumiracoxib analogs the mean Log P, polar surface area, and formula weight are 3.00, 70.46 A2, and 276.60, respectively. For valdecoxib analogs the mean Log P, polar surface area, and formula weight are 3.65, 68.46 A2, and 322.32, respectively. Grubbs test analysis of seven properties for seven known COX-2 selective inhibitors and those of 26 analog compounds indicated no outliers. The unpaired t-test compared Log P and polar surface area of seven known COX-2 inhibitors to all 26 analogs and found no difference. All 26 analogs showed no violation of the Rule of 5, this being an indicator of favorable bioavailability. Hierarchical cluster analysis by single linkage indicated lumiracoxib is most similar to analogs 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, and 17. Valdecoxib has highest similarity to analogs 8, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, and 28. Multiple regression analysis successfully produced equations for prediction of similar compounds to lumiracoxib and valdecoxib. Path analysis indicated that number of atoms, oxygen amp nitrogen atoms, and Log P are the greatest determinants for formula weight for known COX-2 inhibitors. Criteria for molecular properties is established for identifying COX-2 inhibitors. These 26 analogs show much potential for active COX-2 inhibition."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs are considered in cancer therapy for their inhibitory effect on cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2, which is overexpressed in most cancers. However, we found that NSAIDs as ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- PPAR-induced apoptosis independent of the COX-2 inhibition, and the process was mediated through activation of proline dehydrogenase/proline oxidase PRODH/POX-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species ROS. This mitochondrial enzyme converts proline to 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate P5C during which ATP or ROS is generated. To confirm the role of PRODH/POX in the mechanism of NSAID-induced apoptosis we obtained an MCF7 CRISPR/Cas9 PRODH/POX knockout breast cancer cell model MCF7POK-KO. Interestingly, the studied NSAIDs indomethacin and diclofenac in MCF7POK-KO cells contributed to a more pronounced pro-apoptotic phenotype of the cells than in PRODH/POX-expressing MCF7 cells. The observed effect was independent of ROS generation, but it was related to the energetic disturbances in the cells as shown by an increase in the expression of AMPK sensor of cell energy status, GLUD1/2 proline producing enzyme from glutamate, prolidase proline releasing enzyme, PPAR growth supporting transcription factor and a decrease in the expression of proline cycle enzymes PYCR1, PYCRL, mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR, and collagen biosynthesis the main proline utilizing process. The data provide evidence that the studied NSAIDs induce PRODH/POX-dependent and independent apoptosis in MCF7 breast cancer cells."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs showed effects in some hyperproliferative dermatologic pathologies. The aim of the study is the assessment of anti-psoriasis effect of diclofenac and celecoxib using a mice tail model. The topical application of substances on the proximal mice tails was performed for two weeks. The effects on the epidermal granular layer and mean epidermal thickness excluding the stratum corneum were evaluated using hematoxylin-eosin staining. Orthokeratosis degree and percentual drug activity were calculated. A positive control group treated with tretinoin and two negative controls white soft paraffin and untreated mice were used. Orthokeratosis degree significantly increased in all the NSAIDs groups celecoxib 1, 2 and diclofenac 1, 2 and in the tretinoin 0.05 group, versus negative controls. Celecoxib 1 and 2, tretinoin 0.05 and white soft paraffin significantly increased mean epidermal thickness, versus untreated mice. The values obtained in the case of celecoxib 2 ointment regarding the orthokeratosis degree and percentual drug activity are providing premises for further investigations regarding this effect and the mechanisms of action involved. Celecoxib 2 had the greatest percentual drug activity and is a promising substance for the anti-psoriasis topical treatment. Along with the COX-2 inhibition, celecoxib might have an anti-psoriasis effect by other independent mechanisms."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"Ischemia/reperfusion injury IRI is an inevitable complication of liver surgery and transplantation. The purpose of this study was to examine the beneficial effects of diclofenac on hepatic IRI and the mechanism behind it. Wistar rats livers were subjected to warm ischemia for 60 min followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Diclofenac was administered intravenously 15 min before ischemia at 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg body weight. To determine the mechanism of diclofenac protection, the NOS inhibitor L-Nitro-arginine methyl ester L-NAME was administered intravenously 10 min after diclofenac injection 40 mg/kg. Liver injury was evaluated by aminotransferases ALT and AST activities and histopathological analysis. Oxidative stress parameters SOD, GPX, MPO, GSH, MDA, and PSH were also determined. Then, eNOS gene transcription and p-eNOS and iNOS protein expressions were evaluated. The transcription factors PPAR- and NF-B in addition to the regulatory protein IB were also investigated. Finally, the gene expression levels of inflammatory COX-2, IL-6, IL-1, IL-18, TNF-, HMGB-1, and TLR-4 and apoptosis Bcl-2 and Bax markers were measured. Diclofenac, at the optimal dose of 40 mg/kg, decreased liver injury and maintained histological integrity. It also reduced oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Its mechanism of action essentially depended on eNOS activation rather than COX-2 inhibition, since pre-treatment with L-NAME abolished all the protective effects of diclofenac. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that diclofenac protects rat liver against warm IRI through the induction of NO-dependent pathway. Diclofenac reduced oxidative balance, attenuated the activation of the subsequent pro-inflammatory response and decreased cellular and tissue damage. Therefore, diclofenac could be a promising molecule for the prevention of liver IRI."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"In this article, we present the first detailed analysis of the hydro-distilled essential oil HDEO of the inflorescence heads of Echinops polyceras Boiss. Asteraceae from the flora of Jordan, offering observations at different growth pre-flowering, full-flowering and post-flowering stages. Additionally, we investigated the methanolic extract obtained from the aerial parts of the plant material at the full flowering stage in order to determine its inhibitory activity in terms of COX and protein denaturation and evaluate its antimicrobial effects against S. aureus Gram-positive and E. coli Gram-negative bacteria. Performing GC/MS analysis of HDEO, obtained from the fresh inflorescence heads at the different growth stages, resulted in the identification of 192 constituents. The main class of compounds detected in these three stages comprised aliphatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives, which amounted to 50.04 pre-flower, 40.28 full-flower and 41.34 post-flower of the total composition. The oils also contained appreciable amounts of oxygenated terpenoids, primarily sesquiterpenoids and diterpenoids. The pre-flowering stage was dominated by 2E-hexenal 8.03 in addition to the oxygenated diterpene 6E,10E-pseudo phytol 7.54. The full-flowering stage primarily contained 6E,10E-pseudo phytol 7.84, -bisabolene 7.53, SH and the diterpene hydrocarbon dolabradiene 5.50. The major constituents detected in the HDEO obtained at the post-flowering stage included the oxygenated sesquiterpenoid intermedeol 5.53, the sesquiterpene hydrocarbon E-caryophyllene 5.01 and 6E,10E-pseudo phytol 4.47. The methanolic extract obtained from air-dried aerial parts of E. polyceras displayed more COX-2 inhibition than COX-1 inhibition at a concentration level of 200 g/mL. The extract exhibited a capacity to inhibit protein denaturation that was comparable with respect to the activity of diclofenac sodium and displayed moderate levels of antimicrobial activity against both bacterial species. The current results demonstrate the need to perform further detailed phytochemical investigations to isolate and characterize active constituents."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"BACKGROUND Macrophages play a serious part in the instigation, upkeep, and resolution of inflammation. They are activated or deactivated during inflammation progression. Activation signals include cytokines IF-, granulocyte-monocyte colonystimulating factor GM-CSF, and TNF-, extracellular matrix proteins, and other chemical mediators. Activated macrophages are deactivated by anti-inflammatory cytokines IL- 10 and TGF- transforming growth factor-beta and cytokine antagonists that are mainly produced by macrophages. Based on this, the present study aimed to develop novel E- Benzylidene-indazolpyridin methanones Cpd-1-10 as effective anti-inflammatory agents by analyzing pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels in macrophages.   OBJECTIVES To determine the anti-inflammatory effect of indazolpyridin-methanones by examining pro- and anti-inflammatory interleukin levels in J77A.1 macrophages.   METHODS Expression of cytokines such as TNF-, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-10 serum levels measured by ELISA method. Anti-cancer and cytotoxicity studies were carried out by MTT assay. COX-2 seems to be associated with cancers and atypical developments in the duodenal tract. So, a competitive ELISA based COX-2 inhibition assay was done. To validate the inhibitory potentials and to get more insight into the interaction of COX-2 with Cpd1-10, molecular docking was performed.   RESULTS Briefly, the COX-2 inhibitory relative activity was found to be in between the range of 80-92 Diclofenac showed 84, IC50 0.95 M.   CONCLUSION Cytotoxicity effect of the compounds against breast cancer cell lines found excellent and an extended anticancer study ensured that these compounds are also alternative therapeutic agents against breast cancer. Among all the tested cancer cell lines, the anti- cancer effect on breast cancer was exceptional for the most active compounds Cpd5 and Cpd9."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"PURPOSE The therapeutic effect of topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs depends on the drugs ability to penetrate and permeate the skin and subsequently inhibit cyclo-oxygenase COX isoforms responsible for pain and inflammation. Most commercially available topical NSAID formulations are clinically effective, but direct comparisons of anti-inflammatory activity including both skin absorption and inhibitory potency are lacking. This study examined the skin absorption of representative commercially available topical diclofenac- and ibuprofen-based formulations along with published potency values to determine formulations with superior anti-inflammatory activity.   MATERIALS AND METHODS Cumulative absorption and flux profiles of 12 commercially available topical NSAIDs 6 diclofenac-based and 6 ibuprofen-based were evaluated in vitro using human skin in static Franz diffusion cells. Each formulation was applied as a single dose. In vitro permeation parameters and published COX-2 inhibition values were used to calculate a modified index of topical anti-inflammatory activity mITAA.   RESULTS All diclofenac and ibuprofen formulations permeated human skin in vitro. The rate and degree of absorption differed between diclofenac and ibuprofen formulations and between formulations of the same drug. NSAID concentration within a product was not solely responsible for the permeation flux or degree of absorption. Ibuprofen formulations permeated the skin more rapidly and to a greater degree than diclofenac, but calculated mITAAs were higher for diclofenac.   CONCLUSION Diclofenac exhibited superior anti-inflammatory activity as measured by the index. Differences beyond drug concentration, including excipients, drug salt form, and dosage form, contribute to differences in absorption and thus in anti-inflammatory activity. Both absorption and COX-2 inhibition potency are important for anti-inflammatory activity, but their priority depends upon the products being compared-with the same NSAID, absorption determines superiority with different NSAIDs, superiority is determined by the balance between absorption and COX-2 potency. These findings should be considered when selecting a topical NSAID for treating patient pain and inflammation."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs exert their actions by inhibiting cyclooxygenase COX. It has recently been postulated that NSAIDs antiinflammatory efficacy arises from inhibition of the COX-2 isoform of cyclooxygenase, whereas inhibition of the COX-1 isoform produces the troublesome and sometimes serious gastric and renal side effects of NSAIDs. A relatively selective COX-2 inhibitor, such as meloxicam, may combine antiinflammatory efficacy with improved tolerability. In volunteers, indomethacin 75 mg, but not meloxicam 7.5 mg, inhibited renal prostaglandin E2 excretion and platelet aggregation COX-1 mediated effects. Double-blind, randomized trials in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients have shown equivalent antiinflammatory efficacy among meloxicam 7.5 mg or 15 mg and diclofenac 100 mg, naproxen 750 mg, and piroxicam 20 mg. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, meloxicam 7.5 or 15 mg caused less endoscopically detected gastrointestinal GI damage Lanza scale than piroxicam 20 mg. The MELISSA study, a double-blind, randomized, 28-day trial in over 9,000 patients showed that meloxicam 7.5 mg caused statistically less total GI toxicity, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea than diclofenac 100 mg, despite equivalent reductions in pain on movement for each treatment. A global safety analysis of clinical trials, representing over 5,600 patients and comprising 170 and 1,100 patient-years of exposure for meloxicam 7.5 mg and 15 mg, respectively, showed that meloxicam caused less GI toxicity and fewer peptic ulcers and GI bleeds than naproxen, diclofenac, or piroxicam. The renal safety profile and incidence of liver function abnormalities with meloxicam is equivalent to other NSAIDs available for clinical use. In conclusion, relatively selective COX-2 inhibition exemplified by meloxicam may offer effective symptom relief with an improved GI tolerability profile."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN Two structurally related compounds, meloxicam Mel and its structural 4-isomer 4-Mel, were compared to examine the role of a slightly different chemical structure on cyclooxygenase COX selectivity in in vitro and in vivo experimental models.   MATERIAL OR SUBJECTS In vitro studies were performed using human whole blood obtained from healthy volunteers, in vivo studies were performed in rats.   TREATMENT A concentration-response curve was obtained in the whole blood assay for Mel, 4-Mel, indomethacin, piroxicam and diclofenac. These were used to calculate the respective IC50 values of either prostaglandin E2 PGE2 or thromboxane B2 TxB2. Similarly, a dose-response curve was obtained for Mel, 4-Mel and piroxicam when measuring in vivo prostaglandin production, anti-inflammatory activity and gastric tolerance to determine the dose resulting in a 50 reduction of the each parameter.   METHODS COX selectivity was investigated in vitro using a human whole blood assay. PGE2 synthesis in vivo was measured in inflammatory exudate, in the stomach and kidneys of rats. Anti-inflammatory effects were measured in an adjuvant arthritis model and gastric tolerance was tested in an ulcerogenicity model in vivo in rats.   RESULTS In the human whole blood assay, the ratio of IC50 values for COX-1 vs. COX-2 inhibition was 13 for Mel and 1.8 for 4-Mel. In inflammatory exudate in rats, Mel and 4-Mel inhibited PGE2 synthesis to a similar extent, ID50 values approximately 0.3 mg/kg. In contrast, Mel was a weaker inhibitor of PG synthesis than 4-Mel in the rat stomach and in the rat kidney. Paw swelling was reduced by 50 with 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg for Mel and 4-Mel, respectively, in the rat adjuvant arthritis model. Gastric tolerance UD50 was 2.4 mg/kg for Mel and 0.4 mg/kg for 4-Mel.   CONCLUSIONS These data demonstrate that the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological profile of meloxicam is structurally dependent and that minor structural changes can lead to significant differences in the selectivity for COX-1 and COX-2 in vitro and to different profiles in vivo suggesting different therapeutic potential."
Diclofenac,Cyclooxygenase inhibition,"1. Age-associated deterioration of arterial function may result from long-lasting oxidative stress. Since coenzyme Q Q10 has been suggested to protect the vascular endothelium from free radical-induced damage, we investigated the effects of long-term dietary Q10 supplementation on arterial function in senescent Wistar rats. 2. At 16 months of age, 18 rats were divided into two groups. The control group was kept on a standard diet while the other group was supplemented with Q10 10 mg kg-1 day-1. In addition, nine rats age 2 months also ingesting a standard diet were used as the young control group. After 8 study weeks the responses of the mesenteric arterial rings in vitro were examined. 3. Endothelium-independent arterial relaxations to isoprenaline and nitroprusside SNP were attenuated in aged rats. Increased dietary Q10 clearly enhanced the relaxation to isoprenaline, but did not affect the response to SNP. In addition, vasodilation of noradrenaline-precontracted rings to acetylcholine ACh, which was also impaired in aged vessels, was improved after Q10 supplementation. Cyclooxygenase inhibition with diclofenac enhanced the relaxation to ACh only in young rats, while it abolished the difference between the old controls and Q10 supplemented rats, suggesting that the improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation observed in Q10 supplemented rats was largely mediated by prostacyclin PGI2. 4. In conclusion, long-term Q10 supplementation improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation and enhanced beta-adrenoceptor-mediated arterial relaxation in senescent Wistar rats. The mechanisms underlying the improvement of endothelial function may have included augmented endothelial production of PGI2, increased sensitivity of smooth muscle to PGI2, or both."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"Lumiracoxib Prexige is a selective cyclo-oxygenase COX-2 inhibitor developed for the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and acute pain. Lumiracoxib possesses a carboxylic acid group that makes it weakly acidic acid dissociation constant pKa 4.7, distinguishing it from other selective COX-2 inhibitors. Lumiracoxib has good oral bioavailability 74. It is rapidly absorbed, reaching maximum plasma concentrations 2 hours after dosing, and is highly plasma protein bound. Lumiracoxib has a short elimination half-life from plasma mean 4 hours and demonstrates dose-proportional plasma pharmacokinetics with no accumulation during multiple dosing. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, peak lumiracoxib synovial fluid concentrations occur 3-4 hours later than in plasma and exceed plasma concentrations from 5 hours after dosing to the end of the 24-hour dosing interval. These data suggest that lumiracoxib may be associated with reduced systemic exposure, while still reaching sites where COX-2 inhibition is required for pain relief. Lumiracoxib is metabolised extensively prior to excretion, with only a small amount excreted unchanged in urine or faeces. Lumiracoxib and its metabolites are excreted via renal and faecal routes in approximately equal amounts. The major metabolic pathways identified involve oxidation of the 5-methyl group of lumiracoxib and/or hydroxylation of its dihaloaromatic ring. Major metabolites of lumiracoxib in plasma are the 5-carboxy, 4-hydroxy and 4-hydroxy-5-carboxy derivatives, of which only the 4-hydroxy derivative is active and COX-2 selective. In vitro, the major oxidative pathways are catalysed primarily by cytochrome P450 CYP 2C9 with very minor contribution from CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. However, in patients genotyped as poor CYP2C9 metabolisers, exposure to lumiracoxib area under the plasma concentration-time curve is not significantly increased compared with control subjects, indicating no requirement for adjustment of lumiracoxib dose in these subjects. Lumiracoxib is selective for COX-2 compared with COX-1 in the human whole blood assay with a ratio of 515  1 in healthy subjects and in patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. COX-2 selectivity was confirmed by a lack of inhibition of arachidonic acid and collagen-induced platelet aggregation. COX-2 selectivity of lumiracoxib is associated with a reduced incidence of gastroduodenal erosions compared with naproxen and a lack of effect on both small and large bowel permeability. Lumiracoxib does not exhibit any clinically meaningful interactions with a range of commonly used medications including aspirin acetylsalicylic acid, fluconazole, an ethinylestradiol- and levonorgestrel-containing oral contraceptive, omeprazole, the antacid Maalox, methotrexate and warfarin although, as in common practice, routine monitoring of coagulation is recommended when lumiracoxib is co-administered with warfarin. As such, dose adjustments are not required when co-administering these agents with lumiracoxib. In addition, moderate hepatic impairment and mild to moderate renal impairment do not appear to influence lumiracoxib exposure."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"OBJECTIVE Recent findings suggest that permanent blockade of cyclooxygenase 2 COX-2 is one factor contributing to the cardiovascular side effects of selective COX-2 inhibitors coxibs and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs. The present study compared the extent and time course of COX-2 inhibition and the effects on cardiovascular parameters changes in blood pressure and heart rate between various antirheumatic doses of diclofenac, celecoxib, and rofecoxib in healthy elderly volunteers.   METHODS A randomized, parallel-group study was conducted in volunteers receiving 75 mg diclofenac twice daily, 200 mg celecoxib twice daily, or 25 mg rofecoxib once daily for 8 days. Blood samples were obtained predose and at specified time points postdose, on days 1 and 8, for assay of drug plasma concentrations and COX-2 inhibition. Lipopolysaccharide-induced prostaglandin E2 synthesis was measured ex vivo as an index of COX-2 activity in human whole blood.   RESULTS COX-2 inhibition was significantly less pronounced after treatment with celecoxib and rofecoxib than with diclofenac. Maximal inhibitions after a single dose and at steady state, respectively, were as follows 99 and 99 with diclofenac, 70 and 81 with celecoxib, and 56 and 72 with rofecoxib. At steady state, only diclofenac caused virtually complete COX-2 inhibition over the whole dose interval, and this corresponded to the highest increase in systolic blood pressure and greatest reduction in heart rate.   CONCLUSION Diclofenac elicited the most pronounced COX-2 inhibition, blood pressure elevation, and suppression of heart rate. It is assumed that the extent and time course of intravascular COX-2 inhibition may determine the differential profile of cardiovascular side effects associated with NSAIDs and coxibs, but this has to be proven in future studies."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"BACKGROUND amp AIMS It has been variably suggested that nonselective NSAIDs and cyclooxygenase COX-2 selective inhibitors aggravate or ameliorate clinical disease activity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We assessed the effect of these drugs in patients with inflammatory bowel disease n = 209 and the possible mechanisms.   METHODS First, patients with quiescent Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis received the non-NSAID analgesic acetaminophen n = 26 and the conventional NSAIDs naproxen n = 32, diclofenac n = 29, and indomethacin n = 22 for 4 weeks. The Harvey-Bradshaw index was used to define relapse. Second, to assess the mechanism of relapse, intestinal inflammation was quantitated fecal calprotectin before and during treatment 20 patients/group with acetaminophen, naproxen topical effect, COX-1 and -2 inhibitor, nabumetone COX-1 and -2 inhibitor, nimesulide selective COX-2 inhibitor, and low-dose aspirin selective COX-1 inhibition.   RESULTS Nonselective NSAIDs were associated with a 17-28 relapse rate within 9 days of ingestion. No patient had an early relapse on acetaminophen, nimesulide, or aspirin, whereas those on naproxen and nabumetone 20 experienced relapse. These clinical relapses were associated with escalating intestinal inflammatory activity.   CONCLUSIONS NSAID ingestion is associated with frequent and early clinical relapse of quiescent inflammatory bowel disease, and the mechanism appears to be due to dual inhibition of the COX enzymes. Selective COX-2 inhibition with nimesulide and COX-1 inhibition with low-dose aspirin appear to be well-tolerated in the short-term."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"OBJECTIVE Osteoarthritis is one of the most common forms of arthritis seen in primary care. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs play an important role in the management of osteoarthritis. However, gastrointestinal GI side effects limit their use. Cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 selective inhibitors exhibit better GI tolerability than conventional NSAIDs, but their cardiovascular safety is controversial. An NSAID with high efficacy, high GI tolerability and devoid of adverse cardiovascular effects is therefore a profile preferred by physicians. Aceclofenac is an anti-inflammatory and analgesic drug with preferential COX-2 inhibition. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of aceclofenac in the treatment of osteoarthritis in an Indian population.   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The trial was controlled, comparative, randomized, and double-blind. The study included 247 patients 82 males and 165 females, 40-82 years, suffering from osteoarthritis. Patients were randomized to receive either aceclofenac 100 mg twice daily or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily.   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Clinical assessment was done at screening, randomization, and at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks of treatment by calculating Western Ontario MacMaster WOMAC scores, time taken to walk 100 feet, visual analogue scores for pain, investigators assessment on a Likert scale and joint tenderness. Tolerability assessment was based on adverse events. Patient compliance was also assessed.   RESULTS Aceclofenac was found to be statistically superior to diclofenac in efficacy parameters of WOMAC scores, investigators assessment and joint tenderness. Aceclofenac was found to be statistically superior to diclofenac in terms of epigastric discomfort, dyspepsia and abdominal pain. Compliance was also better with aceclofenac. The overall response of patients osteoarthritis to aceclofenac was found to be statistically superior to diclofenac by both physician and patient.   CONCLUSIONS Aceclofenac is an effective and well-tolerated drug in osteoarthritis in the Indian setting."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"Clinical investigations have demonstrated a relationship between the extended use of rofecoxib and the increased risk for atherothrombotic events. This has led to the removal of rofecoxib from the market and concern over the cardiovascular safety of other cyclooxygenase COX-2 selective agents. Experimental findings from independent laboratories now indicate that the cardiotoxicity of rofecoxib may not be a class effect but because of its intrinsic chemical properties. Specifically, rofecoxib has been shown to increase the susceptibility of human low-density lipoprotein and cellular membrane lipids to oxidative modification, a contributing factor to plaque instability and thrombus formation. Independently of COX-2 inhibition, rofecoxib also promoted the nonenzymatic formation of isoprostanes and reactive aldehydes from biologic lipids. The basis for these observations is that rofecoxib alters lipid structure and readily forms a reactive maleic anhydride in the presence of oxygen. By contrast, other selective celecoxib, valdecoxib and nonselective naproxen, diclofenac inhibitors did not influence rates of low-density lipoprotein and membrane lipid oxidation. We have now further confirmed these findings by demonstrating that the prooxidant activity of rofecoxib can be blocked by the potent antioxidant astaxanthin in homochiral form all-trans 3S, 3S. These findings provide a mechanistic rationale for differences in cardiovascular risk among COX-selective inhibitors because of their intrinsic physicochemical properties."
Diclofenac,caspase-3 activation,"Growing evidence indicates that inducible cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders and various types of cancer. Endothelial progenitor cells recruited from the bone marrow have been shown to be involved in the formation of new vessels in malignancies and discussed for being a key point in tumour progression and metastasis. However, until now, nothing is known about an interaction between COX and endothelial progenitor cells EPC. Expression of COX-1 and COX-2 was detected by semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blot. Proliferation kinetics, cell cycle distribution and rate of apoptosis were analysed by MTT test and FACS analysis. Further analyses revealed an implication of Akt phosphorylation and caspase-3 activation. Both COX-1 and COX-2 expression can be found in bone-marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells in vitro. COX-2 inhibition leads to a significant reduction in proliferation of endothelial progenitor cells by an increase in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. COX-2 inhibition leads further to an increased cleavage of caspase-3 protein and inversely to inhibition of Akt activation. Highly proliferating endothelial progenitor cells can be targeted by selective COX-2 inhibition in vitro. These results indicate that upcoming therapy strategies in cancer patients targeting COX-2 may be effective in inhibiting tumour vasculogenesis as well as angiogenic processes."

Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"We provide comprehensive knowledge on the differential regulation of expression and catalysis of cyclooxygenase COX-1 and COX-2 in health and disease which represents an essential requirement to read out the clinical consequences of selective and nonselective inhibition of COX-isozymes in humans. Furthermore, we describe the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics of major traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs tNSAIDs and coxibs selective COX-2 inhibitors which play a prime role in their efficacy and toxicity. Important information derived from our pharmacological studies has clarified that nonselective COX inhibitors should be considered the tNSAIDs with a balanced inhibitory effect on both COX-isozymes exemplified by ibuprofen and naproxen. In contrast, the tNSAIDs meloxicam, nimesulide and diclofenac which are from 18- to 29-fold more potent towards COX-2 in vitro and coxibs i.e. celecoxib, valdecoxib, rofecoxib, etoricoxib and lumiracoxib, which are from 30- to 433-fold more potent towards COX-2 in vitro should be comprised into the cluster of COX-2 inhibitors. However, the dose and frequency of administration together with individual responses will drive the degree of COX-2 inhibition and selectivity achieved in vivo. The results of clinical pharmacology of COX inhibitors support the concept that the inhibition of platelet COX-1 may translate into an increased incidence of serious upper gastrointestinal bleeding but this effect on platelet COX-1 may mitigate the cardiovascular hazard associated with the profound inhibition of COX-2-dependent prostacyclin PGI2."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"Lumiracoxib is a selective cyclooxygenase COX-2 inhibitor that possesses a carboxylic acid group that makes it weakly acidic. It has good oral bioavailability maximum plasma concentrations are reached two hours after oral administration. Despite its short elimination half-life of four hours from the plasma, the drug is distributed to inflamed tissues and is retained for up to 24 hours. This unique property suggests that lumiracoxib, while having reduced systemic exposure, can still reach sites where COX-2 inhibition is required for pain relief. Lumiracoxib is metabolized extensively with only a small amount excreted in the urine. Selectivity for COX-2 is high compared to all other similar agents. It is indicated for the relief of pain in osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute pain and primary dysmenorrhea. Lumiracoxib has been found to be effective at doses of 100-400 mg once a day for chronic pain and 400 mg/day for acute pain. Large clinical trials where lumiracoxib was administered to patients with osteoarthritis have demonstrated that this drug is equally effective as other COX-2 inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs. In comparison to NSAIDs, patients taking lumiracoxib experience significantly fewer adverse events and greater tolerability. It has also been shown to be effective in acute pain states, like the dental pain model and postoperative pain after orthopedic surgery. A large clinical study TARGET has demonstrated the gastrointestinal safety of lumiracoxib over one year. The study also showed that there was no increase in cardiovascular events in non-high-risk patients. However, a black box warning similar to those accompanying other COX-2 inhibitors has been placed by regulatory agencies that have approved this drug for clinical use. When lumiracoxib is coadministered with warfarin or aspirin, no dosage adjustment is required."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"Lumiracoxib is the first example of a marketed COX-2 inhibitor of the arylacetic acid class, and it is reported to be the most selective COXIB in vivo. However, the molecular basis of its COX-2 inhibition has not been completely defined. Using standard assays, lumiracoxib was found to be a poor inhibitor of purified ovine COX-1 and a relatively weak inhibitor of purified human COX-2. The extent of COX-2 inhibition plateaued at around 50 and suggested that the inhibitor may be reversibly bound to the enzyme. Kinetic studies with lumiracoxib demonstrated that it was a time-dependent and slowly reversible inhibitor of human COX-2 that exhibited at least two binding steps during inhibition. Derivatives of lumiracoxib were synthesized with or without the methyl group on the phenylacetic acid ring and with various substitutions on the lower aniline ring. Inhibition studies demonstrated that the methyl group on the phenylacetic acid ring is required for COX-2 selectivity. The chemical identity and position of the substituents on the lower aniline ring were important in determining the potency and extent of COX inhibition as well as COX-2 selectivity. Mutation of Ser-530 to Ala or Val-349 to Ala or Leu abolished the potent inhibition observed with wild-type human COX-2 and key lumiracoxib analogs. Interestingly, a Val-349 to Ile mutant was inhibited with equal potency to human COX-2 with 2,6-dichloro-, 2,6-dimethyl-, or 2-chloro-6-methyl-substituted inhibitors and, in the case of lumiracoxib, actually showed an increase in potency. Taken together with a recent crystal structure of a lumiracoxib-COX-2 complex, the kinetic analyses presented herein of the inhibition of mutant COX-2s by lumiracoxib allows the definition of the molecular basis of COX-2 inhibition."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"Elucidation of differences between the active sites of COX-1 and COX-2 allowed the targeted design of the selective COX-2 inhibitors known as coxibs. They were marketed as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs that had improved upper gastrointestinal GI safety compared with older non-selective NSAIDs such as diclofenac and naproxen. Two GI safety studies conducted with arthritis patients demonstrated that in terms of upper GI safety, celecoxib was not superior to diclofenac CLASS study but rofecoxib was superior to naproxen VIGOR study. However, the VIGOR study revealed also that rofecoxib had increased cardiovascular CV risk compared with naproxen. This clinical outcome was supported by the existence of plausible eicosanoid-based biological mechanisms whereby selective COX-2 inhibition could increase CV risk. Nevertheless, the existence of CV risk with rofecoxib was successfully discounted by its pharmaceutical company owner, Merck amp Co, with the assistance of specialist opinion leaders and rofecoxib achieved widespread clinical use for 4-5 years. Rofecoxib was withdrawn from the market when several clinical trials in colorectal cancer and post-operative pain revealed increased CV risk with not only rofecoxib, but also coxibs. The commercial success of rofecoxib provides a case-study of failure of the medical journal literature to guide drug usage. Attention to ethical issues may have provided a more useful guide for prescribers."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"NSAIDs are effective by inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which leads to formation of prostaglandins. At the beginning of the 90-ties it became evident, that cyclooxygenase existed in two isoforms COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is found in a number of tissues. In these tissues prostaglandins have several physiological functions. COX-2 is an induceable enzyme involved in inflammation. A new NSAID, rofecoxib, has selective COX-2 inhibition defined as inhibition of COX-2, but not COX-1 in the therapeutic dose range. Trial results have shown pain relief analogous to common NSAIDs ibuprofen and diclofenac in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. The incidence of gastric ulcers was significantly reduced in the rofecoxib treated group compared to the groups treated with common NSAIDs. It is concluded that selective COX-2 inhibition is a promising new treatment. At present it seems appropriate to consider the drug in patients with good indication for an NSAID and simultaneous gastrointestinal risk factors."
Diclofenac,COX-2 inhibition,"Non-opioid analgesics are some of the most widely used therapeutic agents in clinical practice today. The number of patients at risk for adverse events related to the use of these agents is rapidly expanding. While the gastrointestinal toxicity of these medications is well known, it has become increasingly apparent that the kidney is also an important target for untoward clinical events. Evidence of the nephrotoxicity of analgesic preparations is not sufficiently completed and available in our region. Analgesic-related renal injury has been classified based on mechanism of action into ""classic"" analgesic nephropathy and NSAID-related renal toxicity. From clinical point of view the renal side effects induced by analgesics can be classified into hemodynamic functional side effects and idiosyncratic side effects. The common link in both types of side effects seems to be renal ischemia related to prostaglandin synthesis inhibition. Key enzyme in this process is cyclooxygenase occurring in two isoforms COX-1 and COX-2. Antiinflammatory effect of NSAIDs is mediated by COX-2 inhibition, while the side effects gastrotoxicity, nephrotoxicity by inhibition of COX-1. COX-1 was more inhibited by indomethacin and piroxicam and COX-2 by 6-MNA active metabolite of nabumetone, diclofenac and ibuprofen. Nimesulide and meloxicam selectively block COX-2 and are recommended to patients at risk or treated with diuretics. Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 38."
Diphenylamine,COX-2 inhibition,"Robenacoxib and ketoprofen are acidic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs. Both are licensed for once daily administration in the cat, despite having short blood half-lives. This study reports the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic PK/PD modelling of each drug in a feline model of inflammation. Eight cats were enrolled in a randomized, controlled, three-period cross-over study. In each period, sterile inflammation was induced by the injection of carrageenan into a subcutaneously implanted tissue cage, immediately before the subcutaneous injection of robenacoxib 2 mg/kg, ketoprofen 2 mg/kg or placebo. Blood samples were taken for the determination of drug and serum thromboxane TxB2 concentrations measuring COX-1 activity. Tissue cage exudate samples were obtained for drug and prostaglandin PGE2 concentrations measuring COX-2 activity. Individual animal pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters for COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition were generated by PK/PD modelling. S ketoprofen clearance scaled by bioavailability CL/F was 0.114 L/kg/h elimination half-life = 1.62 h. For robenacoxib, blood CL/F was 0.684 L/kg/h elimination half-life = 1.13 h. Exudate elimination half-lives were 25.9 and 41.5 h for S ketoprofen and robenacoxib, respectively. Both drugs reduced exudate PGE2 concentration significantly between 6 and 36 h. Ketoprofen significantly suppressed gt97 serum TxB2 between 4 min and 24 h, whereas suppression was mild and transient with robenacoxib. In vivo IC50 COX-1/IC50 COX-2 ratios were 66.91 for robenacoxib and 1107 for S ketoprofen. The carboxylic acid nature of both drugs may contribute to the prolonged COX-2 inhibition in exudate, despite short half-lives in blood."
Diphenylamine,caspase-3 activation,"Tumour necrosis factor-alpha TNF-alpha- and lipopolysaccharide LPS-induced apoptosis of bovine glomerular endothelial cells is now recognized as an important part in the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis characterized by early mitochondrial cytochrome c release, mitochondrial permeability transition, Bak protein upregulation, Bcl-XL protein downregulation and caspase-3 activation. Co-treatment of cells with 10 nM dexamethasone and TNF-alpha or LPS blocked roughly 90 of apoptotic cell death in glomerular endothelial cells. The action of glucocorticoids could be documented in that they prevented all apoptotic markers such as DNA laddering, DNA fragmentation measured by the diphenylamine assay as well as morphological alterations. To mechanistically elucidate the action of glucocorticoids we evaluated whether glucocorticoids elicit a time-dependent effect. For dexamethasone, to maximally inhibit DNA fragmentation a preincubation period was not required. Even if dexamethasone was supplemented 6 h following TNF-alpha or LPS we observed a maximal inhibitory effect. Concerning its influence on TNF-alpha and LPS signal transduction, we found that dexamethasone only partially prevented cytochrome-c-release as a first sign of apoptotic cell death but efficiently blocked mitochondrial permeability transition. Moreover, TNF-alpha- and LPS-induced Bak upregulation, Bcl-XL-downregulation, and the activation of caspase-3-like proteases, measured fluorometrically using DEVD-AMC and PARP cleavage, were efficiently blocked by dexamethasone. We postulate that glucocorticoids exert their inhibitory action upstream of the terminal death pathways but downstream of primary receptor mediated signals by blocking pro-apoptotic signals pre- and/or post cytochrome c release and mitochondrial signalling."
Diphenylamine,caspase-3 activation,"Zearalenone ZEN is a fusarotoxin converted predominantly into alpha-zearalenol alpha-Zol and beta-zearalenol beta-Zol by hepatic hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. The feeding of naturally contaminated grains with ZEN was associated with hyperestrogenic and adverse effects on humans and animals. There is a lack of information on the attribution of the toxic effects of these toxins. One wonders if these effects are due to the parent molecule ZEN or to its major metabolites alpha-Zol and beta-Zol. Using human Caco-2 cells, we looked for the molecular mechanisms of toxicity of ZEN, alpha-Zol, and beta-Zol. Toxicity effects were studied by MTT viability assay and oxidative stress induction by measuring malondialdehyde MDA generation. To check whether the oxidative stress induction was associated to DNA lesions, we looked for DNA fragmentation by means of the Comet and the diphenylamine assays. To specify cell death pathway, we investigated caspase-3 activation, confirmed by polyADP-ribose polymerase cleavage and by Bcl-2 depletion. Our results clearly demonstrated that ZEN as well as its two metabolites presented variable toxic effects. They induced cell death and an increase in MDA generation. These effects were associated to DNA fragmentation as well as caspase-3 activation. The observed toxic effects seem to be relieved by the metabolism of ZEN into alpha-Zol and beta-Zol."
Diphenylamine,COX-2 inhibition,"Effective rabbit analgesia is challenging, and there are few studies available on the newer COX-2 selective NSAIDs, such as robenacoxib. This study aimed to establish the pharmacokinetics of oral and subcutaneous robenacoxib, describe its inhibitory actions on COX enzymes, and develop dosing, using six healthy New Zealand white rabbits. Pharmacokinetics were determined from plasma concentrations after oral administration of robenacoxib 0.83-0.96 mg/kg and also after subcutaneous administration 2 mg/kg. The inhibitory actions of robenacoxib were evaluated by measuring plasma concentrations of thromboxane B2 TBX2 and prostaglandin E2 PGE2 as surrogate markers of cyclooxygenase enzyme isoform inhibition. The mean maximum concentration for oral and subcutaneous administration was 0.23 g/ml and 5.82 g/ml, respectively. Oral robenacoxib administration did not demonstrate a significant difference between any time point for PGE2 or TBX2 , though subcutaneous administration did for both. There was no significant difference in PGE2 or TBX2 concentrations at any time point when comparing subcutaneous versus oral routes. Although the results support that plasma robenacoxib exceeds the therapeutic levels compared to dogs and cats, there was little significance in the difference in the changes associated with COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition. Further studies are warranted to determine appropriate dosing, safety, and efficacy in rabbits."

Oral robenacoxib administration did not demonstrate a significant difference between any time point for PGE2Â or TBX2Â , though subcutaneous administration did for both. There was no significant difference in PGE2Â or TBX2Â concentrations at any time point when comparing subcutaneous versus oral routes. Although the results support that plasma robenacoxib exceeds the therapeutic levels compared to dogs and cats, there was little significance in the difference in the changes associated with COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition. Further studies are warranted to determine appropriate dosing, safety, and efficacy in rabbits."
Diphenylamine,caspase-3 activation,"Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced apoptosis of bovine glomerular endothelial cells is now recognized as an important part in the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis characterized by early mitochondrial cytochrome c release, mitochondrial permeability transition, Bak protein upregulation, Bcl-X(L) protein downregulation and caspase-3 activation. Co-treatment of cells with 10 nM dexamethasone and TNF-alpha or LPS blocked roughly 90% of apoptotic cell death in glomerular endothelial cells. The action of glucocorticoids could be documented in that they prevented all apoptotic markers such as DNA laddering, DNA fragmentation measured by the diphenylamine assay as well as morphological alterations. To mechanistically elucidate the action of glucocorticoids we evaluated whether glucocorticoids elicit a time-dependent effect. For dexamethasone, to maximally inhibit DNA fragmentation a preincubation period was not required. Even if dexamethasone was supplemented 6 h following TNF-alpha or LPS we observed a maximal inhibitory effect. Concerning its influence on TNF-alpha and LPS signal transduction, we found that dexamethasone only partially prevented cytochrome-c-release as a first sign of apoptotic cell death but efficiently blocked mitochondrial permeability transition. Moreover, TNF-alpha- and LPS-induced Bak upregulation, Bcl-X(L)-downregulation, and the activation of caspase-3-like proteases, measured fluorometrically using DEVD-AMC and PARP cleavage, were efficiently blocked by dexamethasone. We postulate that glucocorticoids exert their inhibitory action upstream of the terminal death pathways but downstream of primary receptor mediated signals by blocking pro-apoptotic signals pre- and/or post cytochrome c release and mitochondrial signalling."
Diphenylamine,caspase-3 activation,"Zearalenone (ZEN) is a fusarotoxin converted predominantly into alpha-zearalenol (alpha-Zol) and beta-zearalenol (beta-Zol) by hepatic hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. The feeding of naturally contaminated grains with ZEN was associated with hyperestrogenic and adverse effects on humans and animals. There is a lack of information on the attribution of the toxic effects of these toxins. One wonders if these effects are due to the parent molecule (ZEN) or to its major metabolites (alpha-Zol and beta-Zol). Using human Caco-2 cells, we looked for the molecular mechanisms of toxicity of ZEN, alpha-Zol, and beta-Zol. Toxicity effects were studied by MTT viability assay and oxidative stress induction by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) generation. To check whether the oxidative stress induction was associated to DNA lesions, we looked for DNA fragmentation by means of the Comet and the diphenylamine assays. To specify cell death pathway, we investigated caspase-3 activation, confirmed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and by Bcl-2 depletion. Our results clearly demonstrated that ZEN as well as its two metabolites presented variable toxic effects. They induced cell death and an increase in MDA generation. These effects were associated to DNA fragmentation as well as caspase-3 activation. The observed toxic effects seem to be relieved by the metabolism of ZEN into alpha-Zol and beta-Zol."
Genistein,caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND/AIMS Arsenic trioxide As2O3 is a highly effective agent for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia APL. However, consecutively administered As2O3 induces serious adverse cardiac effects, including long QT syndrome LQTs and even sudden cardiac death. Previous studies have shown that genistein Gen exerts anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects. The present study aimed to explore the potential protective effects of Gen on As2O3-induced adverse cardiac effects, and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms.   METHODS A rat model of As2O3-induced QT prolongation was generated by intravenous injection with As2O3. Surface electrocardiogram ECG and hemodynamics were employed to assess the LQTs and cardiac function. Intracellular calcium concentration Ca2i and mitochondrial membrane potential m were measured by confocal microscopy, and cardiomyocytes apoptosis were assessed by TUNEL assay. Western blot was applied to determine protein levels.   RESULTS We found for the first time that treatment with Gen significantly reversed LQTs and dose-dependently improved As2O3-induced impairment of cardiac function. As2O3 elevated Ca2i and Gen mitigated this effect. Meanwhile, Gen significantly reversed As2O3-mediated cardiomyocytes apoptosis. Furthermore, Gen dose-dependently inhibited the phosphorylated JNK and p38-MAPK pp38-MAPK, and blocked m collapse, and further decreased cleaved caspase-3.   CONCLUSION Gen protects against the adverse cardiac effects of As2O3 partly by mitigating cardiomyocytes apoptosis induced by As2O3 through attenuating intracellular calcium overload and downregulating protein expression of p-JNK and pp38-MAPK to ameliorate the damage of m leading to suppression of caspase-3 activation. Gen might be used as an adjunction therapy in APL patients receiving As2O3 treatment to avoid, at least to minimize, the adverse cardiac effects of As2O3."
Genistein,AChE inhibition,"A series of genistein derivatives with carbon spacer-linked alkylbenzylamines were designed, synthesized and tested as multifunctional agents for the treatment of Alzheimers disease AD. The results showed that most of these compounds exhibited good acetylcholinesterase AChE inhibitory activity, with moderate-to-good anti-oxidative activity. Specifically, compounds 10b, 19d and 25d exhibited significant inhibition of -amyloid A aggregation and exhibited metal chelating properties. In particular, 25d inhibited self-induced A1-42 aggregation, Cu2-induced A1-42 aggregation, and human AChE-induced A1-40 aggregation by 35, 77.8, and 36.2, respectively. Moreover, both kinetic analysis of AChE inhibition and the molecular modeling study suggested that 25d binds simultaneously to catalytic active site and peripheral anionic site of AChE. More importantly, compound 25d disassembled the well-structured A fibrils generated by Cu2-induced A aggregation by 72.1. Furthermore, the step-down passive avoidance test showed this compound significantly reversed scopolamine-induced memory deficit in mice. These results suggest that 25d may be a promising multifunctional agent for AD treatment."
Genistein,topoisomerase II binding,"Bioflavonoids are human dietary components that have been linked to the prevention of cancer in adults and the generation of specific types of leukemia in infants. While these compounds have a broad range of cellular activities, many of their genotoxic effects have been attributed to their actions as topoisomerase II poisons. However, the activities of bioflavonoids against the individual isoforms of human topoisomerase II have not been analyzed. Therefore, we characterized the activity and mechanism of action of three major classes of bioflavonoids, flavones, flavonols, and isoflavones, against human topoisomerase IIalpha and IIbeta. Genistein was the most active bioflavonoid tested and stimulated enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage approximately 10-fold. Generally, compounds were more active against topoisomerase IIbeta. DNA cleavage with both enzyme isoforms required a 5-OH and a 4-OH and was enhanced by the presence of additional hydroxyl groups on the pendant ring. Competition DNA cleavage and topoisomerase II binding studies indicate that the 5-OH group plays an important role in mediating genistein binding, while the 4-OH moiety contributes primarily to bioflavonoid function. Bioflavonoids do not require redox cycling for activity and function primarily by inhibiting enzyme-mediated DNA ligation. Mutagenesis studies suggest that the TOPRIM region of topoisomerase II plays a role in genistein binding. Finally, flavones, flavonols, and isoflavones with activity against purified topoisomerase IIalpha and IIbeta enhanced DNA cleavage by both isoforms in human CEM leukemia cells. These data support the hypothesis that bioflavonoids function as topoisomerase II poisons in humans and provide a framework for further analysis of these important dietary components."
Genistein,caspase-3 activation,"Oxidative stress is believed to contribute to neuronal damage induced by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion I/R injury. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the possible antioxidant neuroprotective effect of genistein against neuronal death in hippocampal CA1 neurons following transient global cerebral ischemia in the rat. Transient global cerebral ischemia was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by four-vessel-occlusion for 10min. At various times of reperfusion, the histopathological changes and the levels of mitochondria-generated reactive oxygen species ROS, malondialdehyde MDA, cytosolic cytochrome c and caspase-3 activity in hippocampus were measured. We found extensive neuronal death in the CA1 region at day 5 after I/R. The ischemic changes were preceded by increases in ROS generation and MDA concentration and followed by increased cytosolic cytochrome c, and subsequently caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. Treatment with genistein 15mg/kg, i.p. significantly attenuated ischemia-induced neuronal death. Genistein administration also decreased ROS generation, MDA concentration and the apoptotic indices. These results suggest that genistein protects neurons from transient global cerebral I/R injury in rat hippocampus by attenuating oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and the signaling cascade leading to apoptotic cell death."
Genistein,caspase-3 activation,"Estrogen exerts neuroprotective effects and reduces beta-amyloid accumulation in models of Alzheimers disease AD. A few years ago, a new neuroprotective gene, i.e. seladin-1 for selective AD indicator-1, was identified and found to be down-regulated in AD vulnerable brain regions. Seladin-1 inhibits the activation of caspase-3, a key modulator of apoptosis. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the seladin-1 gene encodes 3beta-hydroxysterol Delta24-reductase, which catalyzes the synthesis of cholesterol from desmosterol. We have demonstrated previously that in fetal neuroepithelial cells, 17beta-estradiol 17betaE2, raloxifene, and tamoxifen exert neuroprotective effects and increase the expression of seladin-1. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether seladin-1 is directly involved in estrogen-mediated neuroprotection. Using the small interfering RNA methodology, significantly reduced levels of seladin-1 mRNA and protein were obtained in fetal neuroepithelial cells. Seladin-1 silencing determined the loss of the protective effect of 17betaE2 against beta-amyloid and oxidative stress toxicity and caspase-3 activation. A computer-assisted analysis revealed the presence of half-palindromic estrogen responsive elements upstream from the coding region of the seladin-1 gene. A 1490-bp region was cloned in a luciferase reporter vector, which was transiently cotransfected with the estrogen receptor alpha in Chinese hamster ovarian cells. The exposure to 17betaE2, raloxifene, tamoxifen, and the soy isoflavones genistein and zearalenone increased luciferase activity, thus suggesting a functional role for the half-estrogen responsive elements of the seladin-1 gene. Our data provide for the first time a direct demonstration that seladin-1 may be considered a fundamental mediator of the neuroprotective effects of estrogen."
Genistein,caspase-3 activation,"OBJECTIVES Our previous studies have shown that, contrary to many other human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines, AsPC1 cells are resistant to the apoptotic effect of the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, also called Apo2L TRAIL/Apo2L. In our in vitro studies, the combination of TRAIL/Apo2L and protein synthesis inhibitor, genistein, but not genistein alone, was, however, effective in inducing apoptosis in AsPC1 cells. In the present study, we examined the effect of TRAIL/Apo2L with genistein on the growth of AsPC1 cells in vitro and in vivo.   METHODS Mice with orthotopically transplanted AsPC1 cells were treated either with TRAIL/Apo2L, Genistein Gen or a combination of both TRAIL/Apo2L  Gen for 14 days. After 14 days, the size and weight of the tumors were registered and the apoptosis of the tumor cells were determined by the TUNEL method. In vitro, the effect of combination treatment on cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT assay and apoptosis was assessed by DAPI staining. FADD, caspase 3, and PARP proteins were determined by Western blot.   RESULTS No toxic side effects were observed in either group. The tumor volume was significantly smaller and the apoptotic ratio was higher in the TRAIL  Gen group than in the other 2 groups. The apoptotic effect was associated with the caspase-3 activation. Z-VAD-FMK partially inhibited apoptosis by TRAIL  Gen.   CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that the combination of TRAIL/Apo2L with genistein presents a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Further detail investigations are needed, however, to verify the mechanisms of this combination therapy."
Genistein,caspase-3 activation,"More than half of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma ALCL are associated with chromosomal translocation t25p23q35 that leads to the expression of nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase NPM-ALK oncoprotein. NPM-ALK activates the antiapoptotic phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in cell survival and apoptosis. Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway has been considered as a therapeutic target for cancer where PI3K/Akt activation is a causative factor. Genistein, a natural isoflavonoid found in soy products, has been shown to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in a wide variety of cell lines. Here, we demonstrated that treatment of two t25 ALCL cell lines, SUDHL-1 and Karpas299, with genistein induced apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Concurrently, these cells exhibited a decrease in Akt protein levels and subsequent downregulation of Akt activity Akt phosphorylation. Furthermore, genistein treatment induced mitochondrial membrane potential change, caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. From these results, we conclude that inhibition of the Akt signaling pathway and induction of apoptosis by genistein could be used as a new treatment modality for the prevention and/or treatment of t25 ALCL and other hematopoietic malignancies."
Genistein,caspase-3 activation,"Oxidative stress is a key apoptotic stimulus in neuronal cell death and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson disease PD. Recently, we demonstrated that protein kinase C-delta PKCdelta is an oxidative stress-sensitive kinase that can be activated by caspase-3-dependent proteolytic cleavage to induce apoptotic cell death in cell culture models of Parkinson disease Kaul, S., Kanthasamy, A., Kitazawa, M., Anantharam, V., and Kanthasamy, A. G. 2003 Eur. J. Neurosci. 18, 1387-1401 and Kanthasamy, A. G., Kitazawa, M., Kanthasamy, A., and Anantharam, V. 2003 Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 5, 609-620. Here we showed that the phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue in PKCdelta can regulate the proteolytic activation of the kinase during oxidative stress, which consequently influences the apoptotic cell death in dopaminergic neuronal cells. Exposure of a mesencephalic dopaminergic neuronal cell line N27 cells to H2O20-300 microm induced a dose-dependent increase in cytotoxicity, caspase-3 activation and PKCdelta cleavage. H2O2-induced proteolytic activation of PKC was delta mediated by the activation of caspase-3. Most interestingly, both the general Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein 25 microm and the p60Src tyrosine-specific kinase inhibitor TSKI 5 microm dramatically inhibited H2O2 and the Parkinsonian toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium-induced PKCdelta cleavage, kinase activation, and apoptotic cell death. H2O2 treatment also increased phosphorylation of PKCdelta at tyrosine site 311, which was effectively blocked by co-treatment with TSKI. Furthermore, N27 cells overexpressing a PKCdeltaY311F mutant protein exhibited resistance to H2O2-induced PKCdelta cleavage, caspase activation, and apoptosis. To our knowledge, these data demonstrate for the first time that phosphorylation of Tyr-311 on PKCdelta can regulate the proteolytic activation and proapoptotic function of the kinase in dopaminergic neuronal cells."
Genistein,caspase-3 activation,"There is increasing evidence that food-derived polyphenols have a beneficial effect for cancers. Our purpose was to determine the effect and mechanism of action of these compounds on pancreatic cancer. We measured effects of quercetin on pancreatic cancer in a nude mouse model. We also investigated the effects of quercetin, rutin, trans-resveratrol and genistein on apoptosis and underlying signaling in pancreatic carcinoma cells in vitro. Quercetin decreased primary tumor growth, increased apoptosis and prevented metastasis in a model of pancreatic cancer. In vitro quercetin and trans-resveratrol, but not rutin, markedly enhanced apoptosis, causing mitochondrial depolarization and cytochrome c release followed by caspase-3 activation. In addition, the effect of a combination of quercetin and trans-resveratrol on mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activity was greater than the expected additive response. The inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition prevented cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation and apoptosis caused by polyphenols. Nuclear factor-kappa B activity was inhibited by quercetin and trans-resveratrol, but not genistein, indicating that this transcription factor is not the only mediator of the polyphenols effects on apoptosis. The results suggest that food-derived polyphenols inhibit pancreatic cancer growth and prevent metastasis by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in cytochrome c release, caspase activation and apoptosis."
Genistein,COX-2 inhibition,"The molecular mechanisms of the vascular effects of phytoestrogens are poorly studied. Prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator synthesized by two isoforms of cyclooxygenase COX in endothelium. This study examine the effects of two phytoestrogens, the isoflavones genistein and daidzein, on prostacyclin production by cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVECs and the possible role of not only estrogen receptors but also both COX isoforms. The two phytoestrogens significantly increased prostacyclin release in a time- and dose-dependent 0.01-1 microM manner, being higher than control after 24 h. Selective inhibitors of COX-1, SC-560 5-4-chlorophenyl-1-4-methoxypjenyl-3-trifluoromethyl-1H-pyrazole, and COX-2, NS-398 N-2-cyclohexyloxy-4 nitrophenyl-methanesulfonamide, were used to investigate the relative contribution of each enzyme. Both inhibitors decreased basal production of prostacyclin, but only COX-2 inhibition completely abolished the isoflavone-stimulated prostacyclin production. Phytoestrogens also increased COX-2 mRNA expression and protein content without affecting COX-1 levels. All these effects were mediated through estrogen receptor activation since treatment of cells with the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182780 7alpha-94,4,5,5,5-pentafluoropentylsulfinylnonyl-estra-1,3,510-triene-3,17beta diol completely abolished the isoflavone-induced increase in prostacyclin production, COX-2 mRNA expression, and COX-2 protein content. The results clearly support the hypothesis that genistein and daidzein increased HUVEC prostacyclin production through estrogen receptor-dependent mechanism, which involved the enhancement of COX-2 protein and activity."
Genistein,caspase-3 activation,"Since there is evidence for estrogen and estrogen-like compounds to have beneficial effect on the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma HCC, this study was designed to investigative the apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects of these compounds on the human hepatoma Hep3B cell line. The Hep3B cells were treated with 17beta-estradiol E2, diethylstilbestrol DES, tamoxifen, and genistein. After treatments of these compounds at the concentration of 10-6 or 10-8 M, the Hep3B cells were demonstrated to have significant DNA fragmentation, nucleus condensation, cytochrome-c leaking from the mitochondria and caspase-3 activation by DAPI and Western blotting. The cells were also observed to have declined proliferative potential by MTT assay, arrested cell cycle by flow-cytometry measurements. However, the cytochrome-c leaking from the mitochondria induced by E2 and E2-like compounds was blocked totally by ICI 182,780 treatment. These finding suggest that estrogen and the estrogen-like compounds may induce anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects in Hep3B cells, and the E2 and the E2-like compounds mediated apoptotic effect was estrogen receptor dependent. Among the drugs tested, E2, E2 agonists DES and genistein and partial antagonist tamoxifen, all showed the stronger anti-tumor potential."
Genistein,caspase-3 activation,"Genistein GEN, a natural isoflavonoid phytoestrogen, has anti-cancer activity against various types of cancers. However, GEN has not been thoroughly investigated in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In this study, we evaluated the anti-cancer effects of GEN on SNU-449 cells. GEN inhibited the proliferation of SNU-449 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. We observed the typical characteristics of apoptosis, such as DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation. To identify proteins related to GEN-induced apoptosis, we performed two-dimensional electrophoresis and identified differentially expressed proteins. Proteomic analysis showed that the antioxidant protein thioredoxin-1 was associated with GEN-induced apoptosis. GEN treatment decreased thioredoxin-1 levels and increased intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species. In addition, GEN activated apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, c-Jun N-terminal kinases JNK and p38. We also observed that pretreatment with the JNK and p38 inhibitors SP600125 and SB203580 decreased GEN-induced cell death. These results indicate that GEN has potential antitumor effects against SNU-449 cells through the down-regulation of thioredoxin-1."
Genistein,caspase-3 activation,"Multiple myeloma MM is a malignant tumor and is the most common primary tumor of the bone marrow in the USA. Genistein is predominantly found in Leguminosae and various lines of evidence have indicated that it suppresses cell growth, induces programmed cell death and inhibits angiogenesis. As a result of these capabilities, genistein presents as a promising cancer chemopreventive agent. However, the effect of genistein on MM remains to be elucidated. The present study investigated the effect of genistein on the proliferation and apoptosis of MM cells through the regulation of nuclear factor-B NF-B and microRNA-29b miR-29b. In the present study, cell proliferation was examined using a 3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. In addition, apoptosis was detected using an Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide apoptosis assay and caspase-3 activation assay. The expression of NF-B and miR-29b was analyzed using western blotting and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Finally, miR-29b and anti-miR-29b plasmids were transfected into U266 cells to determine the effect of genistein on MM. In the present study, the results demonstrated that genistein could significantly reduce cell proliferation, induce apoptosis and increase the activity of caspase-3 in U266 cells. Furthermore, it was found that genistein could suppress the protein level of NF-B and promote the expression of miR-29b in U266 cells. The results also indicated that miR-29b could alter the expression of NF-B in U266 cells. These findings suggest that genistein inhibits the proliferation of human MM cells by upregulating miR-29b resulting in suppression of NF-B."
Genistein,caspase-3 activation,"Chronic neurodegenerative disorders are having an increasing impact on public health as human longevity increases. Parkinsons disease PD is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system and is characterized by motor system disorders resulting in loss of dopamine-producing brain cells. Pueraria thomsonii Benth. Fabaceae is an herbal medicine that has traditionally been used as an antipyretic agent. In the present study, the active constituents, daidzein and genistein, were isolated from P. thomsonii. Both compounds exhibited neurocytoprotective effects against 6-hydroxydopamine 6-OHDA-induced cytotoxicity in nerve growth factor NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. Neither daidzein nor genistein affected 6-OHDA-induced cellular reactive oxygen species ROS generation according to flow cytometric analysis. Rather, they inhibited caspase-8 and partially inhibited caspase-3 activation, providing a protective mechanism against 6-OHDA-induced cytotoxicity in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. The present results imply that daidzein and genistein may be useful in the development of future strategies for the treatment of PD."
Genistein,caspase-3 activation,"Recently, the treatment of stroke has focused on antioxidant therapies, where oxidative stress is implicated. The preventive and therapeutic potential of plant compounds on ischemic stroke has been intensively studied because many of them contain antioxidant properties. Genistein, one of the active ingredients in soybean, possesses many bioactivities. In this study, we investigated the potential neuroprotective effects of genistein and its possible mechanism of action in a cerebral ischemia mouse model. Mice were pretreated with genistein 2.5, 5, and 10mg/kg or vehicle orally once daily for 14 consecutive days before transient middle cerebral artery occlusion was performed. Genistein at doses of 2.5-10mg/kg significantly reduced the infarct volume, improved the neurological deficit and prevented cell apoptosis after ischemia. In addition, genistein pretreatment was shown to inhibit the ischemia-induced reactive oxygen species ROS production, enhance the activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase SOD and glutathione peroxidase GPx, and decrease levels of malondialdehyde MDA in stroke mice. Moreover, genistein reversed the mitochondria dysfunction after ischemia, as evidenced by decreasing mitochondria ROS levels, preventing cytochrome C release to the cytoplasm and inhibiting caspase-3 activation. Western blotting showed ischemia activated the ROS-dependent nuclear factor-B NF-B signaling pathway, and genistein suppressed phosphorylation and activation of the NF-B p65 subunit, as well as the phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitor protein of B IB. Our findings suggested that genistein has a neuroprotective effect in transient focal ischemia, which may involve regulation of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathways and suppression of ROS-induced NF-B activation."
Genistein,caspase-3 activation,"Diets high in soy are neuroprotective in experimental stroke. This protective effect is hypothesized to be mediated by phytoestrogens contained in soy, because some of these compounds have neuroprotective effects in in vitro models of cell death. We tested the ability of the soy phytoestrogens genistein, daidzein, and the daidzein metabolite equol to protect embryonic rat primary cortical neurons from ischemic-like injury in vitro at doses typical of circulating concentrations in human populations 0.1-1 microM. All three phytoestrogens inhibited lactate dehydrogenase LDH release from cells exposed to glutamate toxicity or the calcium-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin. In cells exposed to hypoxia or oxygen-glucose deprivation OGD, pretreatment with the phytoestrogens inhibited cell death in an estrogen receptor ER dependent manner. Although OGD results in multiple modes of cell death, examination of alpha-spectrin cleavage and caspase-3 activation revealed that the phytoestrogens were able to inhibit apoptotic cell death in this model. In addition, blockade of phosphoinositide 3-kinase prevented the protective effects of genistein and daidzein, and blockade of mitogen-activated protein kinase prevented genistein-dependent neuroprotection. These results suggest that pretreatment with dietary levels of soy phytoestrogens can mimic neuroprotective effects observed with estrogen and appear to use the same ER-kinase pathways to inhibit apoptotic cell death."
Genistein,caspase-3 activation,"Isoflavone genistein may have beneficial effects on vascular function, but the mechanism is unclear. Here, we investigated whether genistein protects vascular endothelial cells against apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. We show that genistein significantly inhibited TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in human aortic endothelial cells as determined by caspase-3 activation, 7-amino actinomycin D staining, in situ apoptotic cell detection and DNA laddering. The anti-apoptotic effect of genistein was associated with an enhanced expression of Bcl-2 protein and its promoter activity. Inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, protein kinase A, or estrogen receptors had no effect on the cytoprotective effect of genistein. However, inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 completely abolished this genistein effect. Accordingly, stimulation of HAECs with genistein resulted in rapid activation of p38beta, but not p38alpha. These findings provide the evidence that genistein acts as a survival factor for vascular ECs to protect cells against apoptosis via activation of p38beta. Preservation of the functional integrity of the endothelial monolayer may represent an important mechanism by which genistein exerts its vasculoprotective effect."
Genistein,estrogen receptor activity,"BACKGROUND Because of the complexity of estrogen receptor ER physiological activity, the interaction of pure isoflavones or soy-based diets on ER needs to be clearly demonstrated.   OBJECTIVES To investigate the effects of the administration of isoflavones as a pure compound or as a component of diet on the ER transcriptional activity in adult mice.   METHODS Effects of acute 6 h and chronic 21 days oral administration of soy milk, pure genistein and a mix of genistein and daidzein was studied in living ERE-Luc mice. In this animal model, the synthesis of luciferase is under the state of ER transcriptional activity. Luciferase activity was measured in living mice by daily bioluminescence imaging sessions and in tissue extracts by enzymatic assay.   RESULTS Acute, oral administration of genistein or soymilk caused a significant increase of ER activity in liver. In a 20 day long treatment, soymilk was more potent than genistein in liver and appeared to extend its influence on ER transcriptional activity in other tissues, such as the digestive tract. A mixture of pure genistein and daidzein at the same concentration as in soymilk failed to induce significant changes during acute and chronic studies suggesting an important, uncharacterized role of the soymilk matrix. Consistent with this observation, synergistic effects of the matrix plus isoflavones were observed in MCF-7 cells stably transfected with the ERE-luc construct.   CONCLUSIONS This study underlines the limitations of the analysis of single food components in the evaluation of their effects on estrogen receptor activity and advocates the necessity to use complex organisms for the full comprehension of the effects of compounds altering the endocrine balance."
Genistein,caspase-3 activation,"Ultraviolet UV light is a strong apoptotic trigger that can induce a caspase-dependent biochemical change in cells. We previously showed that UV irradiation can elicit caspase-3 activation and the subsequent cleavage and activation of p21-activated kinase 2 PAK2 in human epidermal carcinoma A431 cells. We report that genistein, an isoflavone compound with known inhibitory activities to protein tyrosine kinases PTKs and topoisomerase-II topo-II, can prevent UV irradiation-induced apoptotic biochemical changes DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation, and cleavage/activation of PAK2 in A431 cells. Surprisingly, two typical PTK inhibitors tyrphostin A47 and herbimycin A and three known topo-II inhibitors etoposide, daunorubicin, and novomycin had no effect on UV irradiation-induced apoptotic biochemical changes, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of genistein is not dependent on its property as a PTK/topo-II inhibitor. In contrast, azide, a reactive oxygen species ROS scavenger, could effectively block the UV irradiation-induced apoptotic cell responses. Flow cytometric analysis using the cell-permeable dye 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate as an indicator of the generation of ROS showed that UV irradiation caused increase of the intracellular oxidative stress and that this increase could be abolished by azide, suggesting that oxidative stress plays an important role in mediating the apoptotic effect of UV irradiation. Importantly, the UV irradiation-induced oxidative stress in cells could be significantly attenuated by genistein, suggesting that impairment of ROS formation during UV irradiation is responsible for the antiapoptotic effect of genistein. Collectively, our results demonstrate the involvement of oxidative stress in the UV irradiation-induced caspase activation and the subsequent apoptotic biochemical changes and show that genistein is a potent inhibitor for this process."
Genistein,caspase-3 activation,"Hypertonic NaCl upregulated two sensitive and specific biochemical indices of apoptosis, caspase-3 activation and annexin V binding, in a time- and dose-dependent fashion in renal medullary mIMCD3 cells. Pretreatment with urea 200 mM for 30 min protected from the proapoptotic effect of hypertonic stress 200 mosmol/kgH2O in this model. The protective effect of urea was dose dependent and was effective even when applied a short time lt or =1 h following NaCl exposure this protective effect was not observed in the nonrenal 3T3 cell line. In both mIMCD3 and 3T3 cells, urea failed to protect from the proapoptotic stressor, ultraviolet UV-B irradiation. The ability of urea to protect from hypertonic stress was approximately comparable to the protective effect of peptide mitogens epidermal growth factor and insulin-like growth factor IGF, but it potentiated the IGF effect. Interestingly, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, potentiated the proapoptotic effect of urea yet abrogated the proapoptotic effect of hypertonic stress. In aggregate, these data indicate that urea protects from the proapoptotic effect of hypertonic stress in a potentially cell type-specific and stimulus-specific fashion."
Genistein,caspase-3 activation,"Although previous studies demonstrated that genistein-induced apoptosis of various cell types including RPE-J cells, the involvement of mitochondrial events in such types of apoptosis has not been demonstrated to date. In this investigation of genistein-induced apoptosis of RPE-J cells, genistein induced the reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c to cytosol. A mitochondrial permeability transition pore PTP blocker bongkrekic acid prevented the reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release, and consequently abolished caspase-3 activation, nuclear condensation, and DNA fragmentation. On the other hand, zVAD-fmk did not inhibit the mitochondrial event such as the reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release although it prevented caspase-3 activation, nuclear condensation, and DNA fragmentation. Taken together, genistein induces apoptosis of RPE-J cells by opening the mitochondrial PTP, and the mitochondrial event in this type of apoptosis is caused independently of caspase."

Niflumic acid,COX-2 inhibition,"BACKGROUND Cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 directs the synthesis of prostaglandins including PGE-2 linking inflammation with mitogenic signaling. COX-2 is also an anticancer target, however, treatment strategies have been limited by unreliable expression assays and by inconsistent tumor responses to COX-2 inhibition.   METHODS We analyzed the TCGA and Directors Challenge lung cancer datasets n = 188 and also generated an LKB1-null lung cancer gene signature n = 53 to search the Broad Institute/Connectivity-MAP C-MAP dataset. We performed ChIP analyses, real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and drug testing of tumor cell lines n = 8 and primary lung adenocarcinoma surgical resections n = 13.   RESULTS We show that COX-2 is a target of the cAMP/CREB coactivator CRTC1 signaling pathway. In addition, we detected a correlation between LKB1 status, CRTC1 activation, and presence of glycosylated, but not inactive hypoglycosylated COX-2 in primary lung adenocarcinoma. A search of the C-MAP drug database discovered that all high-ranking drugs positively associated with the LKB1-null signature are known CRTC1 activators, including forskolin and six different PGE-2 analogues. Somatic LKB1 mutations are present in 20.0 of lung adenocarcinomas, and we observed growth inhibition with COX-2 inhibitors in LKB1-null lung cancer cells with activated CRTC1 as compared with LKB1-wildtype cells NS-398, P = .002 and Niflumic acid, P = .006 two-tailed t test.   CONCLUSION CRTC1 activation is a key event that drives the LKB1-null mRNA signature in lung cancer. We also identified a positive feedback LKB1/CRTC1 signaling loop for COX-2/PGE2 regulation. These data suggest a role for LKB1 status and glycosylated COX-2 as specific biomarkers that provide a framework for selecting patients for COX-2 inhibition studies."
Paraquat,caspase-3 activation,"In order to establish causal or protective treatments for Parkinsons disease PD, it is necessary to identify the cascade of deleterious events that lead to the dysfunction and death of dopaminergic neurons. Paraquat PQ is a pesticide used as xenobiotic compound to model PD. However, the mechanisms of PQ-induced cell death and the mechanisms of cytoprotection in a single cell model are still unknown. In this study, lymphocytes were treated with 0.1-1 mM PQ. Apoptotic morphology was assessed with acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining. Further evaluation included i superoxide radicals, reflected by nitroblue tetrazolium reduction to formazan, ii the production of hydrogen peroxide, reflected by rhodamine-positive fluorescent cells, iii the generation of hydroxyl radicals, reflected by dimethylsulfoxide and melatonin radicalOH scavengers, iv activation and/or translocation of NF-kappaB, p53 and c-Jun transcription factors showed by immunocytochemical staining, and by ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate, pifithrin-alpha and SP600125 inhibition and V caspase-3 activation, reflected by caspase Ac-DEVD-cho inhibition. To elucidate the mechanism of cytoprotection, lymphocytes were treated with PQ in the presence of cannabinoids, insulin-like growth factor-1 and glucose. We provide evidence that PQ induces apoptosis in lymphocytes in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion by an oxidative stress mechanism involving O2radical -, H2O2/radicalOH generation, simultaneous activation of NF-kappaB/p53/c-Jun transcription factors, mitochondrial depolarization and caspase-3 activation leading to morphological apoptosis. Moreover, dying lymphocytes are protected and rescued from PQ noxious stimuli by direct antioxidant effect by cannabinoids, receptor mediated signaling by IGF-1, and/or energetic protection by glucose. It is concluded that PQ-induced apoptosis in lymphocytes by a mechanism involving reactive oxygen species generation, mitochondrial dysfunction, transcriptional factors and caspase-3 activation. However, this cell death routine can be reversed by the action of cannabinoids, IGF-1 and glucose. These data may provide innovating therapeutic strategies to intervene environmentally or genetically susceptible PD population to oxidative stress."
Paraquat,caspase-3 activation,"Both genetic and environmental factors are thought to be involved in the aetiology of Parkinsons disease PD. Oxidative damage, mitochondrial and proteasomal dysfunction, and inflammatory change are considered to participate in PD pathogenesis. Dopamine agonists are used in the symptomatic treatment of PD but attention has recently also been focussed on their potential for use in slowing disease progression. We have studied the protective actions of the D2 dopamine agonist cabergoline in toxin paraquat and genetic wild-type and mutant A53T alpha-synuclein models of PD using SHSY-5Y cells. Cabergoline increased glutathione content, reduced free radical production and caspase-3 activation, increased mitochondrial membrane potential and ameliorated cell death in SHSY-5Y cells exposed to paraquat and this action was inhibited in part by D2 receptor blockade. Cabergoline also reduced the toxicity of wild-type and mutant alpha-synuclein expression following paraquat exposure by similar mechanisms. These results confirm the protective action of cabergoline in reducing cell death in two separate genetic and environmental model systems of PD."
Paraquat,caspase-3 activation,"AIMS This study aimed to investigate the role of Toll-like receptor 9 in paraquat-induced acute lung injury ALI.   MAIN METHODS For in vivo study,C57BL mice were randomly assigned into the vehicle control group, paraquat group, paraquat  TLR9 antagonist ODN2088 group, and TLR9 antagonist ODN2088 group n=36 per group. After paraquat 30mg/kg ip for 2, 24 and 48h, serum samples and lung tissues were collected to evaluate ALI and TLR9 signaling by lung injury score, protein levels of TLR9, MyD88, p-IRAK4, p-p65, and serum TNF- and IL-1 levels. As for in vitro research A549 cells were randomly divided into the control group, paraquat group, paraquat  TLR9 siRNA group, and TLR9 siRNA group. After paraquat treatment for 24h, the cells and supernatant were collected to measureTLR9, TNF-, IL-1 mRNA expression, and detect activation of NF-B, caspase-3.   KEY FINDINGS In vivo, the lung injury score, the TLR9, MyD88, p-IRAK4 and p-p65 protein levels, and cytokines TNF- and IL-1 levels in paraquat group were significantly higher than that in the control groupTLR9 blocker ODN2088 pretreatment attenuated lung injury, inhibited MyD88 and NF-B activation, and reduced TNF- and IL-1 in serum. In vitro result shows that the gene silencing of TLR9 reduced the mRNA expression of TLR9, TNF- and IL-1, inhibited NF-B and caspase-3 activation, attenuated cell apoptosis.   SIGNIFICANCE TLR9 mediates paraquat-induced ALI, antagonizing TLR9 or silencing TLR9gene may attenuate paraquat-induced ALI."
Paraquat,AChE inhibition,"Paraquat PQ is a widely used non-selective contact herbicide shown to produce memory and learning deficits after acute and repeated exposure similar to those induced in Alzheimers disease AD. However, the complete mechanisms through which it induces these effects are unknown. On the other hand, cholinergic and glutamatergic systems, mainly in the hippocampus, are involved on learning, memory and cell viability regulation. An alteration of hippocampal cholinergic or glutamatergic transmissions or neuronal cell loss may induce these effects. In this regard, it has been suggested that PQ may induce cell death and affect cholinergic and glutamatergic transmission, which alteration could produce neuronal loss. According to these data, we hypothesized that PQ could induce hippocampal neuronal loss through cholinergic and glutamatergic transmissions alteration. To prove this hypothesis, we evaluated in hippocampal primary cell culture, the PQ toxic effects after 24h and 14 consecutive days exposure on neuronal viability and the cholinergic and glutamatergic mechanisms related to it. This study shows that PQ impaired acetylcholine levels and induced AChE inhibition and increased CHT expression only after 14days exposure, which suggests that acetylcholine levels alteration could be mediated by these actions. PQ also disrupted glutamate levels through induction of glutaminase activity. In addition, PQ induced, after 24h and 14days exposure, cell death on hippocampal neurons that was partially mediated by AChE variants alteration and cholinergic and gultamatergic transmissions disruption. Our present results provide new view of the mechanisms contributing to PQ neurotoxicity and may explain cognitive dysfunctions observed after PQ exposure."
Paraquat,caspase-3 activation,"Nostoc colonies have been used as food and medicine for centuries, and their main supporting matrix is polysaccharides, which help Nostoc cells resist various environmental stresses including oxidative stress. Here we isolated a polysaccharide, nostoglycan, from cultured Nostocsphaeroides colonies and determined its physicochemical properties, which revealed a characteristic infrared absorption spectrum typical of polysaccharides and an amorphous morphology with rough surfaces. We also show that nostoglycan has strong moisture absorption and retention capacities and a high relative viscosity. Using Caenorhabditis elegans models, we then demonstrate that nostoglycan is capable of improving overall survival rate of the animals under increased oxidative stress caused by paraquat. Nostoglycan also reduces reactive oxygen species level, inhibits protein carbonyl formation and lipid peroxidation, and increases activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in paraquat-exposed nematodes. As oxidative stress may drive tumor progression, we further demonstrate that nostoglycan can suppress the proliferation of several types of tumor cells and induce apoptosis of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells via caspase-3 activation. Together, our results yield important information on the physicochemical characteristics and demonstrate the antioxidant and anti-proliferative functions of nostoglycan, and thus provide an insight into its potential in food and health industries."
Paraquat,caspase-3 activation,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the protective effect and underlying mechanism of the superoxide dismutase mimic, manganese III tetrakis 1-methyl-4-pyridyl porphyrin pentachloride MnTMPyP, on paraquat PQ-induced lung alveolar epithelial-like cell injury.   METHODS Lung alveolar epithelial-like cells A549 were pretreated with 10 M MnTMPyP for 1.5 hr and then cultured with or without PQ 750 uM for 24 hr. Cell survival was determined using the MTT assay. Apoptosis, mitochondrial transmembrane potential, reactive oxygen species ROS production, and Ca2 levels were measured using flow cytometry. Glutathione reductase activity GR activity and caspase-3 activation were determined using spectrophotometry. Expression of the apoptosis proteins, Bcl-2 and Bax, and the endoplasmic reticulum ER stress proteins, glucose regulatory protein 78 Grp78 and C/EBP homologous protein CHOP, was measured using Western blot analysis.   RESULTS Cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, GR activity, and Bcl-2 expression were decreased, but apoptosis, ROS production, caspase-3 activity, cytoplasmic Ca2 levels, and Bax, Grp78 and CHOP expression were all increased in the PQ group compared to the control group. There were no statistically significant changes in the MnTMPyP group. Cell viability, GR activity, mitochondrial membrane potential, and Bcl-2 protein expression were all increased, while apoptosis, ROS production, cytoplasmic Ca2 levels, caspase-3 activity, and Bax, Grp78 and CHOP expression were all significantly reduced in the MnTMPyP group compared to PQ group.   CONCLUSION MnTMPyP effectively reduced PQ-induced lung epithelial-like cell injury, and the underlying mechanism is related to antagonism of PQ-induced oxidative stress."
Paraquat,caspase-3 activation,"Paraquat has relatively strong detrimental effects on humans and animals and can cause acute lung injury with high mortality. Ghrelin is a brain-gut peptide which plays important roles in regulating various physiological processes. This study investigated whether ghrelin could inhibit paraquat-induced lung injuries and attempted to elucidate the possible molecular mechanisms. A549 cells were preincubated with different concentrations of ghrelin and then treated with 200 M of PQ for 24 h. Then cell survival, apoptosis, cellular oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation of A549 cells were detected after different treatments. Subsequently, we analyzed the mitochondrial membrane potential m and measured caspase-3 activation in A549 cells. In addition, we investigated the activation of the MAPKs pathway and the function of p38-MAPK within mitochondrial apoptosis. Our study indicated that ghrelin administration improved cell viability and reduced apoptosis of PQ-treated A549 cells dose-dependently. Ghrelin treatment reduced the elevation of ROS and MDA, while improved GSH content in A549 cells after paraquat exposure. Moreover, we found that ghrelin dose-dependently increased m and decreased caspase-3 activity. The phosphorylated p38 MAPK and JNK levels elevated following PQ exposure, while the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK decreased following ghrelin pretreatment. p38 MAPK siRNA or SB203580 pretreatment ameliorated PQ-caused cell injury and apoptosis related signals, however, the intracellular ROS production was not affected. N-Acetylcysteine NAC, a classic antioxidant pretreatment decreased the phosphorylated p38 MAPK level and intracellular ROS production, alleviated cell injury, and inhibited apoptosis. The results showed that p38-MAPK pathway plays an important role in PQ-caused alveolar epithelial cell insult, and ghrelin might attenuate PQ-induced cell injury by inhibiting ROS-induced p38-MAPK modulated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway."
Paraquat,caspase-3 activation,"Acute lung injury ALI induced by paraquat PQ progresses rapidly with high mortality however, there is no effective treatment, and the specific mechanism is not well understood. The antiaging protein klotho KL has multiple functions and exerts significant influences on various pathophysiological processes. This work evaluated the impact of KL on PQ-induced ALI and investigated its underlying mechanisms. As for in vivo research, C57BL/6 mice were treated with PQ 30 mg/kg intraperitoneal IP injection to create a toxicity model of ALI PQ group. The mice were divided into control group, KL group, PQ group, and PQKL group. For in vitro experiment, A549 cells were incubated with or without KL and then treated in the presence or absence of PQ for 24 h. In vivo result indicated that KL reduced the mortality, reduced IL-1 and IL-6 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid BALF, attenuated ALI, and decreased apoptosis in situ. In vitro result revealed that KL significantly improved cell viability, reduced the levels of IL-1 and IL-6 in culture supernatants, suppressed cell apoptosis, inhibited caspase-3 activation, and enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential m after PQ treatment. Besides, KL effectively abated reactive oxygen species ROS production, improved GSH content, and lowered lipid peroxidation in PQ-exposed A549 cells. Further experiments indicated that phosphorylated JNK and P38 MAPK was increased after PQ treatment however, KL pretreatment could significantly lower the phosphorylation of P38 MAPK. Suppression of P38 MAPK improved cell viability, alleviated inflammatory response, and reduced apoptosis-related signals however, it had no obvious effect on the production of ROS. Treatment with N-acetylcysteine NAC, a classic ROS scavenger, could suppress ROS production and P38 MAPK activation. These findings suggested that KL could alleviate PQ-caused ALI via inhibiting ROS/P38 MAPK signaling-regulated inflammatory responses and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis."
Paraquat,caspase-3 activation,"Talipexole is a non-ergot dopamine DA agonist that has been used in the treatment of Parkinsons disease. In the present study, we examined the effect of talipexole on paraquat PQ-induced N27 cell death and the intracellular pathways involved in this effect. Pretreatment of N27 cells with talipexole 1mM resulted in significant protection against paraquat-induced cell death. In N27 cells, talipexole inhibited paraquat-induced apoptotic hallmarks such as cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, chromatin condensation and externalization of phosphatidilserine. Talipexole pretreatment prevents the reduction in the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein and increases in the pro-apoptotic form of Bak and p-Bad, both induced by PQ. Finally, we also observed that talipexole abrogates the activation of cell death pathways JNK1/2 and p38 produced by PQ, and increases the phosphorylated active forms of the pro-survival pathways ERK1/2 and Akt. These results reveal that talipexole exerts a neuroprotective effect in a mesencephalic cell line exposed to the neurotoxin PQ, which is related to the etiology of Parkinsons disease."
Paraquat,Increased hyperacetylation of ?-tubulin,"SNCA and MAPT genes and environmental factors are important risk factors of Parkinson's disease [PD], the second-most common neurodegenerative disease. The agrichemicals maneb and paraquat selectively target dopaminergic neurons, leading to parkinsonism, through ill-defined mechanisms. In the current studies we have analyzed the ability of maneb and paraquat, separately and together, to induce synucleinopathy and tauopathy in wild type mice. Maneb was ineffective in increasing ?-synuclein [?-Syn] or p-Tau levels. By contrast, paraquat treatment of mice resulted in robust accumulation of ?-Syn and hyperphosphorylation of Tau in striata, through activation of p-GSK-3?, a major Tau kinase. Co-treatment with maneb did not enhance the effects of paraquat. Increased hyperacetylation of ?-tubulin was observed in paraquat-treated mice, suggesting cytoskeleton remodeling. Paraquat, but not maneb, inhibited soluble proteasomal activity on a peptide substrate but this was not associated with a decreased expression of 26S proteasome subunits. Both paraquat and maneb treatments increased levels of the autophagy inhibitor, mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR, suggesting impaired axonal autophagy, despite increases in certain autophagic proteins, such as beclin 1 and Agt12. Autophagic flux was also impaired, as ratios of LC3 II to LC3 I were reduced in treated animals. Increased mTOR was also observed in postmortem human PD striata, where there was a reduction in the LC3 II to LC3 I ratio. Heat shock proteins were either increased or unchanged upon paraquat-treatment suggesting that chaperone-mediated autophagy is not hampered by the agrichemicals. These studies provide novel insight into the mechanisms of action of these agrichemicals, which indicate that paraquat is much more toxic than maneb, via its inhibitory effects on proteasomes and autophagy, which lead to accumulation of ?-Syn and p-Tau."
Pregnenolone,caspase-3 activation,"Atresia and luteolysis are well-documented processes in which most of the growing ovarian follicles and all corpora lutea, respectively, are eliminated by apoptosis. We have previously reported that LH and FSH enhance caspase-3 and -7 activity and apoptosis in the theca-interstitial cells of rat preovulatory follicles in culture. Here we have used cultured follicles to examine whether LH-induced caspase activation is related to the ability of LH to stimulate steroid production. In these studies, we used three inhibitors of enzymes involved in steroid production aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole, acting on cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage P450scc located at the mitochondria, and epostane, acting on 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase located at the endoplasmic reticulum. We found that treatment with either aminoglutethimide or ketoconazole, but not with epostane, significantly reduced LH-induced caspase-3 and -7 activation and apoptosis, suggesting the mediation of LH-induced caspase activation by P450scc. Supplementing pregnenolone, the product of P450scc catalysis, to follicles treated with aminoglutethimide did not restore LH-induced caspase activation. On the other hand, treatment with antioxidants inhibited LH-induced caspase activation. Moreover, LH treatment was associated with an increase in reactive oxygen species which was inhibited by aminoglutethimide. Thus, P450scc catalysis results in an increase in reactive oxygen species, which in turn may trigger/facilitate caspase-3 activation. Finally, we found that in rat corpora lutea in vivo, an increase in steroidogenesis was accompanied by an increase in caspase activity. Thus, this study reveals a linkage between two seemingly distinct processes in which LH-induced caspase activation in cultured rat preovulatory follicles is coupled to mitochondrial steroidogenesis via P450scc."

Propofol,caspase-3 activation,"Several lines of evidence have extensively demonstrated that peroxynitrite plays a pivotal role in Central Nervous System CNS injuries. The present study was aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanism by which propofol attenuates peroxynitrite-mediated injury in the brain. Primary cultured astroglial cells were incubated for 18 h with a known peroxynitrite donor SIN-1,3 mM in the presence or absence of propofol 40 microM, 80 microM and 160 microM. The protective effects of propofol were evaluated by MTT cytotoxicity assay, LDH release, and caspase-3 activation by Western blot analysis. Appropriate propofol concentrations ranging from 40 microM to 160 microM significantly increased HO-1 expression and attenuated SIN-1-mediated cytotoxicity and caspase-3 activation. The protective effects of propofol were mitigated by the addition of tin-mesoporphirin SnMP, a potent inhibitor of HO activity. The addition of a specific synthetic inhibitor of NF-kappaB abolished propofol-mediated HO-1 induction, suggesting a possible role for this nuclear transcriptional factor in our experimental conditions. These findings indicate that propofol attenuates peroxynitrite-mediated apoptosis in astroglial cells, a property that may be relevant in both physiological and pathological processes in the CNS."
Propofol,Cyclooxygenase inhibition,"BACKGROUND The mechanism by which propofol selectively attenuates the pulmonary vasodilator response to acetylcholine is unknown. The goals of this study were to identify the contributions of endogenous endothelial mediators nitric oxide NO, prostacyclin, and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors EDHFs to acetylcholine-induced pulmonary vasorelaxation, and to delineate the extent to which propofol attenuates responses to these endothelium-derived relaxing factors.   METHODS Canine pulmonary arterial rings were suspended for isometric tension recording. The effects of propofol on the vasorelaxation responses to acetylcholine, bradykinin, and the guanylyl cyclase activator, SIN-1, were assessed in phenylephrine-precontracted rings. The contributions of NO, prostacyclin, and EDHFs to acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation were assessed in control and propofol-treated rings by pretreating the rings with a NO synthase inhibitor l-NAME, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, and a cytochrome P450 inhibitor clotrimazole or SKF 525A alone and in combination.   RESULTS Propofol caused a dose-dependent rightward shift in the acetylcholine dose-response relation, whereas it had no effect on the pulmonary vasorelaxant responses to bradykinin or SIN-1. Cyclooxygenase inhibition only attenuated acetylcholine-induced relaxation at high concentrations of the agonist. NO synthase inhibition and cytochrome P450 inhibition each attenuated the response to acetylcholine, and combined inhibition abolished the response. Propofol further attenuated acetylcholine-induced relaxation after NO synthase inhibition and after cytochrome P450 inhibition.   CONCLUSION These results suggest that acetylcholine-induced pulmonary vasorelaxation is mediated by two components NO and a cytochrome P450 metabolite likely to be an EDHF. Propofol selectively attenuates acetylcholine-induced relaxation by inhibiting both of these endothelium-derived mediators."
Propofol,caspase-3 activation,"PURPOSE The present study, conducted in rats, investigated whether propofol attenuates lipopolysaccharide LPS-triggered liver dysfunction via regulation of tumor necrosis factor TNF- production in activated Kupffer cells.   METHODS Rats received LPS 500 g/kg under Urethane sedation 1 g/kg in combination with propofol 5 mg/kg/h or Intralipid from 1 h before to 6 h after LPS administration. Some rats were treated with 10 mg/kg gadolinium chloride GdCl3 to induce Kupffer cell depletion. The serum levels of alanine aminotransferase ALT and aspartate aminotransferase AST, TNF- mRNA and protein expression, caspase-3 activation and apoptosis were evaluated in hepatocytes. Immunofluorescence staining revealed expression of the pan-macrophage marker CD68 as well as TNF- in Kupffer cells.   RESULTS ALT and AST serum levels increased approximately four-fold in LPS-exposed rats compared with Intralipid-treated rats at 6 h after LPS administration, whereas propofol and GdCl3 reduced the LPS-induced increases. LPS simultaneously augmented TNF- expression in Kupffer cells, followed by increased caspase-3 activity and apoptosis in hepatocytes. Immunofluorescence staining and immunoblotting assay showed that TNF- expression in Kupffer cells was inhibited by propofol and GdCl3, resulting in a reduction of caspase-3 activity and apoptosis in LPS-treated rat hepatocytes.   CONCLUSIONS Propofol 5 mg/kg/h attenuated LPS-triggered liver dysfunction via inhibition of TNF- production in activated Kupffer cells. These results suggest that propofol is capable of inhibiting inflammation-induced liver dysfunction in vivo."
Propofol,caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Propofol, midazolam and ketamine are widely used in todays anaesthesia practice. Both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects have been attributed to all three agents.   OBJECTIVE To establish whether propofol, midazolam and ketamine in the same neuronal injury model exert neuroprotective effects on injured neurones in vitro and in vivo by modulation of the Toll-like receptor 4-nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells TLR-4-NF-B pathway.   DESIGN AND SETTING Cell-based laboratory n = 6 repetitions per experiment and animal n = 6 per group studies using a neuronal cell line SH-SY5Y cells and adult Sprague-Dawley rats.   INTERVENTIONS Cells were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation before or after treatment using escalating, clinically relevant doses of propofol, midazolam and ketamine. In animals, retinal ischaemia 60 min was induced followed by reperfusion and randomised treatment with saline or propofol.   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Neuronal cell death was determined using flow-cytometry mitochondrial membrane potential and lactate dehydrogenase LDH release. Nuclear factor NF-B and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 -activity were analysed by DNA-binding ELISA, expression of NF-B-dependent genes and TLR-4 by luciferase-assay and flow-cytometry, respectively. In animals, retinal ganglion cell density, caspase-3 activation and gene expression TLR-4, NF-B were used to determine in vivo effects of propofol. Results were compared using ANOVA Analysis of Variance and t test. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.   RESULTS Post-treatment with clinically relevant concentrations of propofol 1 to 10 g ml preserved the mitochondrial membrane potential in oxygen-glucose deprivation-injured cells by 54 and reduced LDH release by 21. Propofol diminished TLR-4 surface expression and preserved the DNA-binding activity of the protective hypoxia-inducible factor 1  transcription factor. DNA-binding and transcriptional NF-B-activity were inhibited by propofol. Neuronal protection and inhibition of TLR-4-NF-B signalling were not consistently seen with midazolam or ketamine. In vivo, propofol treatment preserved rat retinal ganglion cell densities cells mm, saline 1504  251 vs propofol 2088  144, P = 0.0001, which was accompanied by reduced neuronal caspase-3, TLR-4 and NF-B expression.   CONCLUSION Propofol, but neither midazolam nor ketamine, provides neuroprotection to injured neuronal cells via inhibition of TLR-4-NF-B-dependent signalling."
Propofol,caspase-3 activation,"The neurotoxicity of anesthetics on the developing brain has drawn the attention of anesthesiologists. Several studies have shown that apoptosis is enhanced by exposure to anesthesia during brain development. Although apoptosis is a physiological developmental step occurring before the maturation of neural networks and the integration of brain function, pathological damage also involves apoptosis. Previous studies have shown that prolonged exposure to anesthetics causes apoptosis. Exactly when the apoptotic cascade starts in the brain remains uncertain. If it starts during the early stage of anesthesia, even short-term anesthesia could harm the brain. Therefore, apoptogenesis should be continuously monitored to elucidate when the apoptotic cascade is triggered by anesthesia. Here, we describe the development of a continuous monitoring system to detect caspase-3 activation using an in vivo model. Brain slices from postnatal days 0-4 SCAT3 transgenic mice with a heterozygous genotype n=20 were used for the monitoring of caspase-3 cleavage. SCAT3 is a fusion protein of ECFP and Venus connected by a caspase-3 cleavable peptide, DEVD. A specimen from the hippocampal CA1 sector was mounted on a confocal laser microscope and was continuously superfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid, propofol 2,6-diisopropylphenol, 1M or 10M, and dimethyl sulfoxide. Images were obtained every hour for five hours. A pixel analysis of the ECFP/Venus ratio images was performed using a histogram showing the number of pixels with each ratio. In the histogram of the ECFP/Venus ratio, an area with a ratiogt1 indicated the number of pixels from caspase-3-activated CA1 neurons. We observed a shift in the histogram toward the right over time, indicating caspase-3 activation. This right-ward shift dramatically changed at five hours in the propofol 1M and 10M groups and was obviously different from that in the control group. Thus, real-time fluorescence energy transfer FRET imaging was capable of identifying the onset of apoptosis triggered by propofol in neonatal brain slices. This model may be a useful tool for monitoring apoptogenesis in the developing brain."
Propofol,caspase-3 activation,"Propofol 2,6-diisopropylphenol is a widely used general anesthetic with anti-oxidant activities. This study aims to investigate protective capacity of propofol against hydrogen peroxide H2O2-induced oxidative injury in neural cells and whether the anti-oxidative effects of propofol occur through a mechanism involving the modulation of NADPH oxidase NOX in a manner of calcium-dependent. The rat differentiated PC12 cell was subjected to H2O2 exposure for 24 h to mimic a neuronal in vitro model of oxidative injury. Our data demonstrated that pretreatment of PC12 cells with propofol significantly reversed the H2O2-induced decrease in cell viability, prevented H2O2-induced morphological changes, and reduced the ratio of apoptotic cells. We further found that propofol attenuated the accumulation of malondialdehyde biomarker of oxidative stress, counteracted the overexpression of NOX core subunit gp91phox NOX2 as well as the NOX activity following H2O2 exposure in PC12 cells. In addition, blocking of L-type Ca2 channels with nimodipine reduced H2O2-induced overexpression of NOX2 and caspase-3 activation in PC12 cells. Moreover, NOX inhibitor apocynin alone or plus propofol neither induces a significant downregulation of NOX activity nor increases cell viability compared with propofol alone in the PC12 cells exposed to H2O2. These results demonstrate that the protective effects of propofol against oxidative injury in PC12 cells are mediated, at least in part, through inhibition of Ca2-dependent NADPH oxidase."
Propofol,COX-2 inhibition,"Propofol is an intravenous anesthetic widely used for sedation and general anesthesia. We investigated the effect of propofol on prostanoid production by activated microglia. Primary microglial culture was obtained from the brains of neonatal C57BL/6 mice. The microglia were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide LPS in the presence of propofol. Propofol suppressed the LPS-induced production of prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2. Cyclooxygenase COX protein expression and arachidonic acid release were not affected by propofol, while COX enzyme activity was significantly inhibited by propofol. The COX-inhibiting activity was also observed with purified enzymes, with COX-2 inhibition being significantly greater than COX-1 inhibition. Next, we studied whether the COX-inhibiting activity of propofol resulted in dopaminergic neuroprotection in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine MPTP murine model of Parkinsons disease, in which COX inhibitors, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are reported to be neuroprotective. C57BL/6 mice received intraperitoneal injections of MPTP with or without propofol treatment, and the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta SNpc were examined immunohistochemically by observing the tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells. The number of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc was significantly reduced by MPTP treatment, while the MPTP-induced neuronal loss was minimal upon treatment with propofol or the selective COX-2 inhibitor, NS-398. These results indicate that propofol might be beneficial in mitigating MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurons, possibly via its COX-inhibiting activity."
Propofol,caspase-3 activation,"Background The cardioprotective effect of propofol on ischemia-reperfusion injury I/R injury is partly due to suppressing apoptosis. Mitochondrial dynamics are also involved in apoptosis. Mitochondrial fusion and fission lead to mitochondrial morphological changes. However, whether suppressing apoptosis effect of propofol against ischemia-reperfusion injury in the heart is via regulating mitochondrial morphology remains unclear. Methods H9c2 cells underwent oxygen glucose deprivation OGD followed by reperfusion to simulate cardiomyocytes ischemia/reperfusion injury. Cell viability, apoptosis ratio and intracellular reactive oxygen species ROS were assessed, respectively. Mitochondrial membrane dynamin family proteins, extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and 2 ERK1/2, phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and 2 p-ERK1/2 and proteins related to intrinsic apoptosis pathways were detected by western blotting. The mitochondrial morphology and the distribution of dynamin-related protein 1 Drp1 were observed by using laser confocal microscopy. Results Propofol enhanced the survival of H9c2 cells, decreased ROS levels and inhibited apoptosis during oxygen glucose deprivation/reperfusion OGD/R injury. Mitochondrial fission in H9c2 cells was inhibited by propofol during OGD injury. Propofol alleviated high levels of mitochondrial fusion and fission during OGD/R in H9c2 cells, by regulating mitochondrial membrane remodeling dynamin family proteins. Propofol inhibited Drp1 colocalization with mitochondria in H9c2 cells during OGD/R injury. Moreover, Drp1 phosphorylation was inhibited by propofol through decreasing ERK activation during OGD/R injury. We found that propofol ameliorated H9c2 cells apoptosis during OGD/R via inhibiting mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-9, caspase-6, caspase-7 and caspase-3 activation. Conclusion Propofol suppresses H9c2 cells apoptosis during OGD/R injury via inhibiting intrinsic apoptosis pathway, which may be partly due to reducing high levels of mitochondrial fusion and fission induced by OGD/R injury."
Propofol,caspase-3 activation,"Propofol Pro is well known to regulate the asleep-awake-asleep technique. Increasing indication recommends that Pro also has promising properties such as anti-oxidant and anti-inflammation belongings in several disease models. It has been described that Pro has beneficial properties against renal ischemia/reperfusion rI/R-mediated acute lung injury ALI. Nevertheless, pathogenesis underlying the beneficial action of Pro on the remote ALI mediated by rI/R remains unwell unstated. In this research, we displayed that Pro administration remarkably inhibits rI/R-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokines production. Increased levels of oxidative stress were mainly decreased by Pro. Pro administration ameliorated apoptosis-related caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, the levels of crucial necroptosis-associated protein were reduced by Pro. Sirtuin 1 SIRT1 inhibitor attenuated the aforementioned changes of Pro. In conclusion, these results propose that Pro attenuates rI/R-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and necroptosis by up-regulation of SIRT1 in rats. Our findings disclose an original pathogenesis underlying the beneficial effect of Pro against rI/R-mediated ALI and reinforce the knowledge that Pro might be a hopeful beneficial agent for the rI/R-mediated ALI."
Propofol,caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Cerebrovascular endothelial cells CECs, major component cells of the blood-brain barrier, can be injured by oxidative stress. Propofol can protect cells from oxidative injury. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of propofol on nitrosative stress-induced insults to CECs and its possible mechanisms.   METHODS Primary CECs isolated from mouse cerebral capillaries were exposed to2 nitric oxide NO donors sodium nitroprusside SNP or S-nitrosoglutathione GSNO. Cellular NO levels, cell morphologies, and cell viabilities were analyzed. DNA fragmentation and apoptotic cells were quantified using flow cytometry. Proapoptotic Bcl2-antagonist-killer Bak and cytochrome c were immunodetected. Bak translocation was analyzed using confocal microscopy. Caspases-9 and -3 activities were measured fluorometrically. Permeability of the CEC monolayer was assayed by measuring the transendothelial electrical resistance.   RESULTS Exposure of CECs to SNP increased cellular NO levels and simultaneously decreased cell viability P lt .01. Meanwhile, treatment of CECs with propofol at a therapeutic concentration 50 M decreased SNP-induced cell death P lt .01. SNP induced DNA fragmentation and cell apoptosis, but propofol decreased the cell injury P lt .01. Sequentially, propofol decreased SNP-enhanced Bak levels and translocation from the cytoplasm to mitochondria P lt .05. Exposure of CECs to propofol attenuated GSNO-induced cell death, apoptosis, and caspase-3 activation P lt .01. Additionally, propofol protected CECs against SNP-induced disruption of the CEC monolayer P lt .05. Consequently, SNP-enhanced cascade activation of caspases-9 and -3 was decreased by propofol P lt .01.   CONCLUSION This study suggested that propofol at a therapeutic concentration can protect against nitrosative stress-induced apoptosis of CECs due to downregulation of the intrinsic Bak-mitochondrion-cytochrome c-caspase protease pathway."
Propofol,caspase-3 activation,"There is a need to seek new treatments for Alzheimers disease AD. A recent study showed that AD patients may have decreased levels of functional GABA receptors. Propofol, a commonly used anesthetic, is a GABA receptor agonist. We therefore set out to perform a proof of concept study to determine whether chronic treatment with propofol 50 mg/kg/week can improve cognitive function in both aged wild-type WT and AD transgenic Tg mice. Propofol was administrated to the WT and AD Tg mice once a week for 8 or 12 weeks, respectively. Morris water maze was used to assess the cognitive function of the mice following the propofol treatment. Activation of caspase-3, caspase-9, and caspase-8 was investigated using western blot analysis at the end of the propofol treatment. In the mechanistic studies, effects of propofol, amyloid- protein A, and GABA receptor antagonist flumazenil on caspase-3 activation and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore were assessed in H4 human neuroglioma and mouse neuroblastoma cells by western blot analysis and flow cytometry. Here we showed that the propofol treatment improved cognitive function and attenuated brain caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation in both aged WT and AD Tg mice. Propofol attenuated A-induced caspase-3 activation and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in the cells, and flumazenil inhibited the propofols effects. These results suggested that propofol might improve cognitive function via attenuating the A-induced mitochondria dysfunction and caspase activation, which explored the potential that anesthetic propofol could improve cognitive function in elderly and AD patients."
Propofol,caspase-3 activation,"Alzheimers disease AD is the most common form of dementia. At the present time, however, AD still lacks effective treatments. Our recent studies showed that chronic treatment with anesthetic propofol attenuated brain caspase-3 activation and improved cognitive function in aged mice. Accumulation of -amyloid protein A is a major component of the neuropathogenesis of AD dementia and cognitive impairment. We therefore set out to determine the effects of chronic treatment with propofol on A levels in brain tissues of aged mice. Propofol 50 mg/kg was administrated to aged 18 month-old wild-type mice once a week for 8 weeks. The brain tissues of mice were harvested one day after the final propofol treatment. The harvested brain tissues were then subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ELISA and Western blot analysis. Here we report that the propofol treatment reduced A A40 and A42 levels in the brain tissues of the aged mice. Moreover, the propofol treatment decreased the levels of -site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme the enzyme for A generation, and increased the levels of neprilysin the enzyme for A degradation in the brain tissues of the aged mice. These results suggested that the chronic treatment with propofol might reduce brain A levels potentially via decreasing brain levels of -site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme, thus decreasing A generation and via increasing brain neprilysin levels, thus increasing A degradation. These preliminary findings from our pilot studies have established a system and postulated a new hypothesis for future research."
Propofol,caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND The inhalation anesthetic isoflurane has been shown to open the mitochondrial permeability transition pore mPTP and induce caspase activation and apoptosis, which may lead to learning and memory impairment. Cyclosporine A, a blocker of mPTP opening might attenuate the isoflurane-induced mPTP opening, lessening its ripple effects. Magnesium and anesthetic propofol are also mPTP blockers. We therefore set out to determine whether propofol and magnesium can attenuate the isoflurane-induced caspase activation and mPTP opening.   METHODS We investigated the effects of magnesium sulfate Mg2, propofol, and isoflurane on the opening of mPTP and caspase activation in H4 human neuroglioma cells stably transfected to express full-length human amyloid precursor protein APP H4 APP cells and in six day-old wild-type mice, employing Western blot analysis and flowcytometry.   RESULTS Here we show that Mg2 and propofol attenuated the isoflurane-induced caspase-3 activation in H4-APP cells and mouse brain tissue. Moreover, Mg2 and propofol, the blockers of mPTP opening, mitigated the isoflurane-induced mPTP opening in the H4-APP cells.   CONCLUSION These data illustrate that Mg2 and propofol may ameliorate the isoflurane-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting its mitochondrial dysfunction. Pending further studies, these findings may suggest the use of Mg2 and propofol in preventing and treating anesthesia neurotoxicity."
Propofol,caspase-3 activation,"AIM To investigate the neuroprotective effect of propofol and its intracellular mechanism on neurons in vitro.   METHODS Cell viability was determined with 3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide reduction. Apoptotic cell death was determined by Hoechst 33258 staining and a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The caspase-3 activity was measured by fluorometric assay. Mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase phosphorylation was detected with Western blotting.   RESULTS The pretreatment of rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 with propofol 1-10 micromol/L resulted in a significant recovery from hydrogen peroxide H2O2-induced cell death and the inhibition of H2O2 induced caspase-3 activation and PC12 cell apoptosis. Propofol inhibited the H2O2-induced p38 MAP kinase, but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase or extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 activations.   CONCLUSION Propofol might attenuate H2O2-induced PC12 cell death through the inhibition of signaling pathways mediated by the p38 MAP kinase."
Propofol,caspase-3 activation,"Accumulation and deposition of -amyloid protein A are the hallmark features of Alzheimers disease. The inhalation anesthetic isoflurane has been shown to induce caspase activation and increase A accumulation. In addition, recent studies suggest that isoflurane may directly promote the formation of cytotoxic soluble A oligomers, which are thought to be the key pathological species in AD. In contrast, propofol, the most commonly used intravenous anesthetic, has been reported to have neuroprotective effects. We therefore set out to compare the effects of isoflurane and propofol alone and in combination on caspase-3 activation and A oligomerization in vitro and in vivo. Nave and stably-transfected H4 human neuroglioma cells that express human amyloid precursor protein, the precursor for A neonatal mice and conditioned cell culture media containing secreted human A40 or A42 were treated with isoflurane and/or propofol. Here we show for the first time that propofol can attenuate isoflurane-induced caspase-3 activation in cultured cells and in the brain tissues of neonatal mice. Furthermore, propofol-mediated caspase inhibition occurred when there were elevated levels of A. Finally, isoflurane alone induces A42, but not A40, oligomerization, and propofol can inhibit the isoflurane-mediated oligomerization of A42. These data suggest that propofol may mitigate the caspase-3 activation by attenuating the isoflurane-induced A42 oligomerization. Our findings provide novel insights into the possible mechanisms of isoflurane-induced neurotoxicity that may aid in the development of strategies to minimize potential adverse effects associated with the administration of anesthetics to patients."
Propofol,caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND The concentration of peroxynitrite in the brain increases after central nervous system injuries. The authors hypothesized that propofol, because of its particular chemical structure, mitigates the effects of peroxynitrite-mediated oxidative stress and apoptosis by the induction of heme oxygenase HO-1 in primary cultured astroglial cells.   METHODS Primary cultured astroglial cells were incubated for 18 h with a known peroxynitrite donor 3 mm SIN-1 in the presence or absence of propofol 40 microm, 80 microm, 160 microm, and 1 mm. The protective effects of propofol were evaluated by 34,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide cytotoxicity assay, lactic dehydrogenase release, DNA ladderization by Comet assay, and caspase-3 activation by Western blot analysis.   RESULTS Appropriate propofol concentrations ranging from 40 microm to 1 mm significantly increased HO-1 expression and attenuated SIN-1-mediated DNA ladderization and caspase-3 activation. The protective effects of propofol were mitigated by the addition of tin mesoporphyrin, a potent inhibitor of HO activity. The addition of a specific synthetic inhibitor of nuclear factor kappaB abolished propofol-mediated HO-1 induction, suggesting a possible role of this nuclear transcriptional factor in our experimental conditions.   CONCLUSIONS The antioxidant properties of propofol can be partially attributed to its scavenging effect on peroxynitrite as well as to its ability to increase HO-1 expression at higher concentrations, a property that might be relevant to neuroprotection during anesthesia."
Propofol,caspase-3 activation,"Propofol is widely used in paediatric anaesthesia and intensive care unit because of its essentially short-acting anaesthetic effect. Recent data have shown that propofol induced neurotoxicity in developing brain. However, the mechanisms are not extremely clear. To gain a better insight into the toxic effects of propofol on hippocampal neurons, we treated cells at the days in vitro 7 DIV 7, which were prepared from Sprague-Dawley embryos at the 18th day of gestation, with propofol 0.1-1000 M for 3 h. A significant decrease in neuronal proliferation and a remarkable increase in neuroapoptosis were observed in DIV 7 hippocampal neurons as measured by 3-4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and apoptosis assay respectively. Moreover, propofol treatment decreased the nuclear factor kappaB NF-B p65 expression, which was accompanied by a reduction in B-cell lymphoma 2 Bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels, increased caspase-3 mRNA and activation of caspase-3 protein. These results indicated that downregulation of NF-B p65 and Bcl-2 were involved in the potential mechanisms of propofol-induced neurotoxicity. This likely led to the caspase-3 activation, triggered apoptosis and inhibited the neuronal growth and proliferation that we have observed in our in vitro systems."
Propofol,caspase-3 activation,"Recent studies have revealed that an intrinsic apoptotic signaling cascade is involved in vascular hyperpermeability and endothelial barrier dysfunction. Propofol 2,6-diisopropylphenol has also been reported to inhibit apoptotic signaling by regulating mitochondrial permeability transition pore mPTP opening and caspase-3 activation. Here, we investigated whether propofol could alleviate burn serum-induced endothelial hyperpermeability through the inhibition of the intrinsic apoptotic signaling cascade. Rat lung microvascular endothelial cells RLMVECs were pretreated with propofol at various concentrations, followed by stimulation with burn serum, obtained from burn-injury rats. Monolayer permeability was determined by transendothelial electrical resistance. Mitochondrial release of cytochrome C was measured by ELISA. Bax and Bcl-2 expression and mitochondrial release of second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspases smac were detected by Western blotting. Caspase-3 activity was assessed by fluorometric assay mitochondrial membrane potential m was determined with JC-1 a potential-sensitive fluorescent dye. Intracellular ATP content was assayed using a commercial kit, and reactive oxygen species ROS were measured by dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate DCFH-DA. Burn serum significantly increased monolayer permeability Plt0.05, and this effect could be inhibited by propofol Plt0.05. Compared with a sham treatment group, intrinsic apoptotic signaling activation - indicated by Bax overexpression, Bcl-2 downregulation, m reduction, decreased intracellular ATP level, increased cytosolic cytochrome C and smac, and caspase-3 activation - was observed in the vehicle group. Propofol not only attenuated these alterations Plt0.05 for all, but also significantly decreased burn-induced ROS production Plt0.05. Propofol attenuated burn-induced RLMVEC monolayer hyperpermeability by regulating the intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway."
Propofol,caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Anesthetic agents eg, isoflurane, propofol may cause neurodegeneration in the developing brains and impair animals learning ability. Dexmedetomidine DEX, a selective alpha 2-adrenoreceptor agonist, has antiapoptotic properties in several brain injury models. Here, we tested whether DEX can protect the brain from neurodegeneration in rats exposed to propofol in utero.   MATERIALS AND METHODS Fetal rats of embryonic day 20 were exposed in utero for 1 hour to propofol anesthesia with DEX or saline, or no anesthesia control. The fetal brains were harvested 6 hours later. Cleaved caspase-3 levels and the relative number of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 IBA1-positive cells were assessed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Learning and memory functions of the offspring in a separate cohort were assessed at postnatal day 35 by using an 8-arm radial maze.   RESULTS Propofol anesthesia in pregnant rats augmented caspase-3 activation by 217 in the brain tissues of fetal rats and increased the number of IBA1-positive cells in the cortex by 40 and in the thalamus by 270. Juvenile rats exposed prenatally to propofol were not different than controls on spontaneous locomotor activity, but made more errors of omission and took longer to complete visiting all 8 arms on days 1, 2, and 3 across a 5-day test in the radial arm maze. This neurocognitive deficit was prevented by administration of DEX 5.0 g/kg, IP, which also significantly inhibited propofol-induced caspase-3 activation and microglial response in the fetal brains.   CONCLUSIONS DEX attenuates neuronal injury induced by maternal propofol anesthesia in the fetal brains, providing neurocognitive protection in the offspring rats."
Propofol,caspase-3 activation,"Intracellular Ca2 overload induced by hypoxia-reoxygenation alters Ca2 homeostasis, which plays an important role in myocardial cell injury. Even though propofol is known as a radical scavenger with Ca2 channel blocking properties, little is known about cardioprotective effect associated with Ca2 homeostasis in cardiomyocytes. In the present study, we showed that propofol protects cardiomyocytes against hypoxia-reoxygenation injury. In propofol-treated cardiomyocytes, we observed a decrease in the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, cytochrome c, caspase-3 activation and intracellular Ca2 content. We also found that propofol treatment enhanced expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and activation of ERK concerned with survival. Propofol attenuated alterations of genes involving Ca2-regulatory mechanism and significantly modulated abnormal changes of SERCA2a genes in hypoxia-reoxygenated neonatal cardiomyocytes. These results suggest that propofol modulates the expression of genes involved in Ca2 homeostasis, thereby producing cardioprotective effects through a reduction in apoptotic cell death."
Tamoxifen,EGFR signaling pathway,"INTRODUCTION Tamoxifen is widely used to treat hormone-dependent breast cancer, but its therapeutic benefit is limited by the development of drug resistance. Here, we investigated the role of estrogen G-protein coupled receptor 30 GPR30 on Tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer.   METHODS Primary tumors PTs of breast cancer and corresponding metastases MTs were used to evaluate the expression of GPR30 and epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR immunohistochemically. Tamoxifen-resistant TAM-R subclones derived from parent MCF-7 cells were used to investigate the role of GPR30 in the development of tamoxifen resistance, using MTT assay, western blot, RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, ELISA and flow cytometry. TAM-R xenografts were established to assess anti-tumor effects of combination therapy with GPR30 antagonist G15 plus 4-hydroxytamoxifen Tam, using tumor volume measurement and Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling TUNEL.   RESULTS In 53 human breast cancer specimens, GPR30 expression in MTs increased compared to matched PTs in MTs, the expression patterns of GPR30 and EGFR were closely related. Compared to parent MCF-7 cells, TAM-R cells had greater growth responses to 17-estradiol E2, GPR30 agonist G1 and Tam, and significantly higher activation of Mitogen-activated protein MAP kinases but this increased activity was abolished by G15 or AG1478. In TAM-R cells, GPR30 cell-surface translocation facilitated crosstalk with EGFR, and reduced cAMP generation, attenuating inhibition of EGFR signaling. Combination therapy both promoted apoptosis in TAM-R cells and decreased drug-resistant tumor progression.   CONCLUSIONS Long-term endocrine treatment facilitates the translocation of GPR30 to cell surfaces, which interferes with the EGFR signaling pathway GPR30 also attenuates the inhibition of MAP kinases. These factors contribute to tamoxifen resistance development in breast cancer. Combination therapy with GPR30 inhibitors and tamoxifen may provide a new therapeutic option for drug-resistant breast cancer."
Tamoxifen,EGFR signaling pathway,"Gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is approved for clinical use in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC. According to statistics, NSCLC patients who are female, have adenocarcinoma, or never smoked have a higher response rate to gefitinib treatment. This phenomenon could be due to the interaction between the estrogen receptor ER and EGFR. To test whether inhibition of the EGFR signaling pathway affects the antitumour effect of gefitinib, NSCLC cell lines were treated with gefitinib and tamoxifen, an ER antagonist. Cotreatment with gefitinib plus tamoxifen decreased the proliferation and increased the apoptosis of A549 and H1650 adencarcinoma cell lines, when compared with either drug alone. However, there was no effect on H520 cells squamous cell carcinoma. Rapid activation of the EGFR pathway by both EGF and beta-E2 was observed in A549 cells. Additionally, EGFR and ERbeta expression was down-regulated in response to estrogen and EGF, respectively, but up-regulated in response to tamoxifen and genfitib, respectively. These results suggest that there is a functional cross-signaling between the EGFR and the ER pathways in NSCLC, possibly providing a rationale to combine gefitinib with anti-estrogen therapy for lung cancer treatment."
Tamoxifen,estrogen receptor activity,"PURPOSE Combination estrogen  progestin therapy has been associated with increased breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women. Selective estrogen receptor modulators SERM are potential alternatives to progestins, although the endometrial safety of estrogen  SERM co-therapies is not known. The goal of this study was to evaluate the endometrial profile of low-dose estradiol and the SERM tamoxifen alone and in combination.   EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Twenty-four postmenopausal female cynomolgus macaques were randomized by social group to receive placebo, low-dose micronized estradiol E2 0.25 mg/1,800 kcal, the SERM tamoxifen Tam 20 mg/1,800 kcal, or E2  Tam for 4 months in a parallel-arm design.   RESULTS Tamoxifen alone resulted in overlapping but distinct effects compared with E2. Both E2 and Tam increased uterine weight and endometrial thickness, whereas only E2 increased endometrial proliferation. Morphologic effects were similar for Tam and E2  Tam, which both induced stromal fibrosis and cystic change. Tamoxifen inhibited E2-induced proliferation and expression of genes related to cell cycle progression while exhibiting mixed agonist and antagonist effects on gene markers of estrogen receptor activity. The gene expression profile for E2  Tam was distinct from either E2 or Tam alone but dominated by the Tam effect for estrogen-regulated genes. Tam also attenuated E2 effects on both vaginal maturation and cervical epithelial height.   CONCLUSIONS These findings characterize a novel phenotype resulting from estrogen  SERM co-therapy. The predominance of Tam effects on endometrial proliferation, morphology, and transcriptional profiles suggests that endometrial risks for E2  Tam may be similar to Tam alone."
Tamoxifen,caspase-3 activation,"Calmodulin CaM antagonists induce apoptosis in various tumor models and inhibit tumor cell invasion and metastasis, thus some of which have been extensively used as anti-cancer agents. In platelets, CaM has been found to bind directly to the cytoplasmic domains of several platelet receptors. Incubation of platelets with CaM antagonists impairs the receptors-related platelet functions. However, it is still unknown whether CaM antagonists induce platelet apoptosis. Here we show that CaM antagonists N-6-aminohexyl-5-chloro-1-naphthalene sulfonamide W7, tamoxifen TMX, and trifluoperazine TFP induce apoptotic events in human platelets, including depolarization of mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential, caspase-3 activation, and phosphatidylserine exposure. CaM antagonists did not incur platelet activation as detected by P-selectin surface expression and PAC-1 binding. However, ADP-, botrocetin-, and alpha-thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, platelet adhesion and spreading on von Willebrand factor surface were significantly reduced in platelets pre-treated with CaM antagonists. Furthermore, cytosolic Ca2 levels were obviously elevated by both W7 and TMX, and membrane-permeable Ca2 chelator BAPTA-AM significantly reduced apoptotic events in platelets induced by W7. Therefore, these findings indicate that CaM antagonists induce platelet apoptosis. The elevation of the cytosolic Ca2 levels may be involved in the regulation of CaM antagonists-induced platelet apoptosis."
Tamoxifen,estrogen receptor activity,"For more than four decades, modulation of estrogen receptor activity with antiestrogens has been a successful strategy for the treatment of breast cancer. However, therapeutic resistance limits this approach. Patients whose tumors lack estrogen receptors are not candidates for antiestrogens. Furthermore, roughly half that do express estrogen receptors fail to respond. Together, these tumors are considered to be de novo resistant. For those with tumors that do respond, most will eventually acquire resistance. As such, the underlying mechanisms of both de novo and acquired resistance have been the subject of considerable research, so that new therapeutic targets might be discovered and developed. From this work, epigenetic regulation of gene expression has emerged as a major contributor to both forms of resistance. In this article, we present our current understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to antiestrogen resistance, focusing on epigenetic regulation, and examine the approaches being used that target epigenetic machinery to overcome resistance both in the laboratory and in the clinic."
Tamoxifen,caspase-3 activation,"Tumor necrosis factor  TNF- is a pleiotropic cytokine mediating inflammatory as well as cell death activities, and is thought to induce chondrocytic chondrolysis in inflammatory and degenerative joint diseases. Selective estrogen receptor modulators SERMs, such as raloxifene, which are commonly used in clinical settings act as estrogen agonists or antagonists. It is assumed that estrogens have a potential role in cartilage protection however, the precise molecular mechanism for the protective effects of estrogens is unclear. This study was designed to examine whether raloxifene inhibits TNF--induced apoptosis in human chondrocytes and to clarify the mechanisms involved. We also investigated the signaling pathways responsible for the anti-apoptotic effect of raloxifene. Apoptosis in chondrocytes was determined by DNA fragmentation assay and caspase-3 activation. Raloxifene significantly inhibited TNF--induced caspase-3 activation and cell DNA fragmentation levels in chondrocytes. The inhibitory effect of raloxifene was abolished by the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ERK1/2 regulates apoptosis, acting as an apoptotic or anti-apoptotic signal. TNF--induced apoptosis was significantly enhanced by the ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor PD98059. Raloxifene stimulated a further increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in TNF--treated chondrocytes. Furthermore, the anti-apoptotic effects of raloxifene were inhibited by PD98059. In addition, the anti-apoptotic effects of raloxifene were completely abolished in ERK1/2 siRNA-treated chondrocytes. These results suggest that raloxifene prevents caspase-3-dependent apoptosis induced by TNF- in human chondrocytes by activating estrogen receptors and the ERK1/2 signaling pathway."
Tamoxifen,caspase-3 activation,"Since there is evidence for estrogen and estrogen-like compounds to have beneficial effect on the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma HCC, this study was designed to investigative the apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects of these compounds on the human hepatoma Hep3B cell line. The Hep3B cells were treated with 17beta-estradiol E2, diethylstilbestrol DES, tamoxifen, and genistein. After treatments of these compounds at the concentration of 10-6 or 10-8 M, the Hep3B cells were demonstrated to have significant DNA fragmentation, nucleus condensation, cytochrome-c leaking from the mitochondria and caspase-3 activation by DAPI and Western blotting. The cells were also observed to have declined proliferative potential by MTT assay, arrested cell cycle by flow-cytometry measurements. However, the cytochrome-c leaking from the mitochondria induced by E2 and E2-like compounds was blocked totally by ICI 182,780 treatment. These finding suggest that estrogen and the estrogen-like compounds may induce anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects in Hep3B cells, and the E2 and the E2-like compounds mediated apoptotic effect was estrogen receptor dependent. Among the drugs tested, E2, E2 agonists DES and genistein and partial antagonist tamoxifen, all showed the stronger anti-tumor potential."
Tamoxifen,estrogen receptor activity,"The estrogen receptor ER, a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, is a hormone-regulated transcription factor that mediates the effects of estrogens and antiestrogens in breast cancer and other estrogen target cells. Because of the role of estrogens in promoting the growth and progression of breast cancer, there is great interest in exploring ways to functionally inactivate the ER, thereby suppressing ER-mediated gene expression and cell proliferation. These approaches have involved the use of antiestrogens such as tamoxifen, dominant negative ERs and, more recently, the use of corepressors. Through the use of two-hybrid screening, we have recently identified a selective repressor of estrogen receptor activity REA. This protein is recruited to the hormone-occupied ER and selectively represses its transcriptional activity but not the other steroid and non-steroid nuclear receptors. REA also interacts with a protein, prothymosin-alpha PTalpha, that selectively enhances ER transcriptional activity by recruiting the repressive REA protein away from ER. Analysis of the mechanisms underlying the activities of these two proteins highlights a new role for REA and PTalpha as activity-modulating proteins that confer receptor specificity."
Tamoxifen,estrogen receptor activity,"The action of nuclear hormone receptors is tripartite, involving the receptor, its ligands, and its coregulator proteins. The estrogen receptor ER, a member of this superfamily, is a hormone-activated transcription factor that mediates the stimulatory effects of estrogens and the inhibitory effects of antiestrogens such as tamoxifen in breast cancer and other estrogen target cells. To understand how antiestrogens and dominant negative ERs suppress ER activity, we used a dominant negative ER as bait in two-hybrid screening assays from which we isolated a clone from breast cancer cells that potentiates the inhibitory activities of dominant negative ERs and antiestrogen-liganded ER. At higher concentrations, it also represses the transcriptional activity of the estradiol-liganded ER, while having no effect on other nuclear hormone receptors. This clone, denoted REA for ""repressor of estrogen receptor activity,"" encodes a 37-kDa protein that is an ER-selective coregulator. Its competitive reversal of steroid receptor coactivator 1 enhancement of ER activity and its direct interaction with liganded ER suggest that it may play an important role in determining the sensitivity of estrogen target cells, including breast cancer cells, to antiestrogens and estrogens."
Tamoxifen,EGFR signaling pathway,"This review considers data on expression of different types of estrogen receptors ER and ER in in vitro cultured cells of non-small cell lung cancer and also in human and animal lung tumors. Estrogens are shown to play an important role in genesis and development of non-small cell lung cancer because the estrogen-stimulated cell proliferation as well as antiestrogen-caused inhibition of proliferation occurred only in the cells expressing different types of estrogen receptors. In general, the situation is similar to that observed in breast cancer, but in the cells of non-small cell lung cancer not ER are expressed in more than half of cases but ER. Just estrogen receptors  play the crucial role in inducing cell proliferation in response to estrogens, and ER is a prognostic marker of a favorable course of non-small cell lung cancer. Data on the interactions between ER and EGFR signaling pathways, as well as on the additive antitumor effect of antiestrogens tamoxifen and fulvestrant combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib, erlotinib, and vandetanib are considered. The review also includes data on the influence of estrogens on genesis and development of lung cancer in humans and animals and the frequency of ER and ER expression in non-small cell lung cancer in tissues from patients of the two sexes. Problems of quantitative determination of  and  estrogen receptors in the tumor cells are also discussed."
Tamoxifen,EGFR signaling pathway,"Antiestrogen therapy has been used successfully to prolong disease-free and overall survival of ER positive breast cancer patients. However, 50 of patients with ER tumors fail to respond to such therapy or eventually acquire resistance to endocrine therapy, resulting in tumor progression and mortality. It is imperative, therefore, to understand the mechanisms that lead to hormone refractory breast cancer in order to develop therapeutics that can modulate the resistance to antiestrogen therapy. The protease, ADAM12, can be detected in the urine of breast cancer patients and its levels correlate with disease status, stage, and cancer risk. Within the context of this study, the authors have investigated the role of the two distinct isoforms of ADAM12 in breast tumor cell proliferation and as potential mediators of endocrine resistance. Using stable clones of ADAM12-overexpressing MCF-7 cells, the authors analyzed proliferation rates of these ER breast tumor cells both in estrogen-depleted medium and in the presence of the antiestrogens, tamoxifen, and ICI 182,780. Acquired estrogen resistance in these cells was analyzed using phospho-RTK analysis. Upregulation and phosphorylation of proteins were detected via immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. EGFR and MAPK inhibitors were used to explore the mechanism of acquired estrogen resistance in breast tumor cells. It was observed that overexpression of the two isoforms, transmembrane ADAM12-L, and secreted ADAM12-S, in breast tumor cells promoted estrogen-independent proliferation. In ADAM12-L-expressing cells, estrogen-independence was a direct result of increased EGFR expression and MAPK activation, whereas, the mechanism in ADAM12-S-expressing cells may be enhanced IGF-1R signaling. The importance of the EGFR signaling pathway in the estrogen-independent growth of ADAM12-L expressing cells was highlighted by the effect of EGFR inhibitors AG1478 and PD15035 or MAPK inhibitor U0126, each of which abolished the antiestrogen resistance in these cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ADAM12 isoforms confer a proliferative advantage to MCF-7 cells in the absence of estrogen stimulation, and suggest that downregulation of ADAM12 in combination with endocrine therapy may represent a useful pharmacological approach to breast cancer therapy."
Tamoxifen,estrogen receptor activity,"This review focuses on significant recent findings regarding modulators of androgen and estrogen receptor activity. Selective androgen receptor modulators SARMs interact with androgen receptors ARs, and selective estrogen receptor modulators SERMs interact with estrogen receptors ERs, with variable tissue selectivity. SERMs, which interact with both ER and ER in a tissue-specific manner to produce diverse outcomes in multiple tissues, continue to generate significant interest for clinical application. Development of SARMs for clinical application has been slower to date because of potential adverse effects, but these diverse compounds continue to be investigated for use in disorders in which modulation of the AR is important. SARMs have been investigated mostly at the basic and preclinical level to date, with few human clinical trials published. These compounds have been evaluated mostly for application in different stages of prostate cancer to date, but they hold promise for multiple other applications. Publication of the large STAR and RUTH clinical trials demonstrated that the SERMs tamoxifen and raloxifene have interesting similarities and differences in tissues that contain ERs. Lasofoxifene, bazedoxifene, and arzoxifene are newer SERMs that have been demonstrated in clinical trials to more potently increase bone mineral density and lower serum cholesterol values than tamoxifen or raloxifene. Both SARMs and SERMs hold great promise for therapeutic use in multiple disorders in which tissue-specific effects are mediated by their respective receptors."
Tamoxifen,caspase-3 activation,"Breast cancer is the second most frequent cancer affecting women worldwide after lung cancer. The toxicity factor associated with synthetic drugs has turned the attention toward natural compounds as the primary focus of interest as anticancer agents. Vitamin E derivatives consisting of the well-established tocopherols and their analogs namely tocotrienols have been extensively studied due to their remarkable biological properties. While tocopherols have failed to offer protection, tocotrienols, in particular, -, -, and -tocotrienols alone and in combination have demonstrated anticancer properties. The discovery of the antiangiogenic, antiproliferative, and apoptotic effects of tocotrienols, as well as their role as an inducer of immunological functions, not only reveals a new horizon as a potent antitumor agent but also reinforces the notion that tocotrienols are indeed more than antioxidants. On the basis of a transcriptomic platform, we have recently demonstrated a novel mechanism for tocotrienol activity that involves estrogen receptor ER signaling. In silico simulations and in vitro binding analyses indicate a high affinity of specific forms of tocotrienols for ER, but not for ER. Moreover, we have demonstrated that specific tocotrienols increase ER translocation into the nucleus which, in turn, activates the expression of estrogen-responsive genes MIC-1, EGR-1 and Cathepsin D in breast cancer cells only expressing ER cells MDA-MB-231 and in cells expressing both ER isoforms MCF-7. The binding of specific tocotrienol forms to ER is associated with the alteration of cell morphology, caspase-3 activation, DNA fragmentation, and apoptosis. Furthermore, a recently concluded clinical trial seems to suggest that tocotrienols in combination with tamoxifen may have the potential to extend breast cancer-specific survival."
Tamoxifen,caspase-3 activation,"Estrogen-related receptor  ERR, a member of the orphan nuclear receptor family, is a key mediator in cellular metabolic processes and energy homeostasis. Therefore, ERR has become an attractive target for treating diverse metabolic disorders. We recently reported that ERR acts as a negative regulator of osteoclastogenesis induced by receptor activator of nuclear factor-B ligand RANKL. In the present study, we explored the effects of an ERR-specific modulator, GSK5182, on ERR-regulated osteoclast differentiation and survival. Interestingly, GSK5182 increased ERR protein levels much as does GSK4716, which is an ERR agonist. GSK5182 inhibited osteoclast generation from bone-marrow-derived macrophages without affecting cytotoxicity. GSK5182 also attenuated RANKL-mediated expression of c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1 NFATc1, pivotal transcription factors for osteoclastogenesis. Arrested osteoclast differentiation was associated with reduced RANK expression, but not with the M-CSF receptor, c-Fms. GSK5182 strongly blocked the phosphorylation of IB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase in response to RANKL. GSK5182 also suppressed NF-B promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. In addition to osteoclastogenesis, GSK5182 accelerated osteoclast apoptosis by caspase-3 activation. Together, these results suggest that GSK5182, a synthetic ERR modulator, may have potential in treating disorders related to bone resorption. BMB Reports 2021 545 266-271."
Tamoxifen,caspase-3 activation,"Raloxifene RAL, a selective estrogen receptor ER modulator SERM seems to induce apoptosis in both androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cell PC lines via activation of ER and an antagonistic effect on ER. In this study, we evaluated the effects of RAL on epithelial PC growth using the two following in vitro models the androgen-dependent cell line EPN which expressed both ERs and a stabilized epithelial cell line derived from a prostate cancer specimen CPEC, which expressed low levels of ER and lacked ER. In EPN cells, there was an increase in the pre-G1 apoptotic peak and a reduction in the S phase of the cell cycle with G0/G1 arrest after E2 or RAL treatment bcl-2 mRNA and Bcl-2 protein levels were significantly reduced, while activated caspase-3 and Par-4 levels increased significantly after either E2 or RAL treatment in addition, c-myc transcript was inhibited after 10-6 M RAL treatment. A dose-dependent increase of metallothionein II gene RNA level was also induced by RAL in EPN. In CPEC, there was only a weak apoptotic peak associated with caspase-3 activation and Par-4 increase after either E2 or RAL treatment while c-myc transcript level increased. RAL induced a rapid but transient phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 in EPN cells but generated a sustained effect in CPEC. These findings suggest that RAL effects on PC growth control in vitro are cell-specific, depending on ER or ER/ER relative expression levels. Moreover, this study demonstrated that RAL affected both transcriptional regulation and non-genomic signals, which resulted in the modulation of multiple signaling pathways of apoptosis and of cell cycle progression."
Tamoxifen,caspase-3 activation,"TRA-8, a monoclonal antibody targeting death receptor, has demonstrated high therapeutic effect for triple negative breast cancer TNBC in preclinical models. Tamoxifen, the standard of care for ER-positive breast cancer, induces apoptosis via ER, which commonly presents in TNBC cells. The current study investigates the combination effects of TRA-8 and tamoxifen for TNBC. In vitro assays were implemented with two ER-positive TNBC cell lines, SUM159 and 2LMP, and in vivo therapy studies were followed using orthotopic breast tumor mouse models. IC50 of tamoxifen for SUM159 and 2LMP were 29 M and 38 M, respectively. Synergy between TRA-8 0-1000 ng/mL and tamoxifen 20 M was observed for both the cell lines. Tamoxifen 400 mg/kg diet markedly suppressed the growth of SUM159 tumors for 6 weeks after therapy initiation, but it did not induce antitumor effect for 2LMP tumors. TRA-8 0.1 mg, weekly, i.p. successfully arrested the growth of both SUM159 and 2LMP tumors during therapy, but an antagonistic effect was observed when tamoxifen was combined. TRA-8 uptake into tumors was not changed by tamoxifen treatment. Histological analysis confirmed that caspase-3 activation induced by TRA-8 was significantly decreased when tamoxifen was used in combination. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the combined use of TRA-8 and tamoxifen may cause antagonistic effects for TNBC patients."
Tamoxifen,caspase-3 activation,"Podocyte injury has been proposed to play an important role in diabetic nephropathy however, its pathological mechanism remains unclear. We have shown that bone morphogenetic protein 4 BMP4 signaling leads to the glomerular changes characteristic of this disorder. To analyze the molecular mechanism of podocyte injury, the effect of BMP4 was investigated using streptozotocin STZ-induced, Bmp4 heterozygous knockout Bmp4/- and podocyte-specific Bmp4 knockout mice. Mice with STZ-induced diabetes exhibited glomerular matrix hyperplasia and decreased numbers of podocyte nucleus-specific WT1-positive cells. The number of podocytes and proteinuria were improved in both diabetic Bmp4 knockout mouse models compared to the effects observed in the control mice. The effect of BMP4 overexpression on Bmp4-induced or podocyte-specific transgenic mice was examined. Tamoxifen-induced Bmp4-overexpressing mice exhibited mesangial matrix expansion and decreased numbers of WT1-positive cells. Podocyte-specific Bmp4-overexpressing mice displayed increased kidney BMP4 expression and mesangial matrix expansion but decreased nephrin expression and numbers of WT1-positive cells. Both lines of Bmp4-overexpressing mice exhibited increased albuminuria. In cultured podocytes, BMP4 increased phospho-p38 levels. BMP4 decreased nephrin expression but increased cleaved caspase-3 levels. p38 suppression inhibited caspase-3 activation. Apoptosis was confirmed in STZ-diabetic glomeruli and Bmp4-overexpressing mice. Bmp4 /- mice with diabetes displayed reduced apoptosis. Based on these data, the BMP4 signaling pathway plays important roles in the development of both podocyte injury and mesangial matrix expansion in diabetic nephropathy."
Tamoxifen,EGFR signaling pathway,"BACKGROUND/AIM ER-positive breast cancer patients commonly undergo endocrine therapy with drugs such as tamoxifen. Despite tamoxifen being a highly effective drug, long-term treatment results in resistance in one-third of the patients. Although many explanations for the development of tamoxifen resistance have been put forward, a clearly defined underlying mechanism is still lacking.   MATERIALS AND METHODS The expression level of HOXB5 was evaluated between MCF7 breast cancer cells and tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 TAMR cells by RT-PCR. Then, the effect of HOXB5 on invasion and migration abilities as well as on cancer stemness were investigated through 3D culture and spheroid formation assay.   RESULTS In this study, we provide evidence that HOXB5 is up-regulated in TAMR cells. EGFR is concurrently overexpressed, and the EGFR signaling cascade is activated, resulting in migratory and invasive phenotypes in TAMR cells compared to MCF7 cells. However, HOXB5 knockdown in TAMR cells resulted in the de-activation of the EGFR signaling pathway, less aggressive phenotypes and restoration of sensitivity to tamoxifen treatment. More interestingly, TAMR cells expressed higher levels of stem cell markers, and as a result, their enhanced stemness allowed for a better formation of spheroids than MCF7 cells. When HOXB5 was overexpressed in MCF7 cells, they were able to form a larger number of spheroids as in TAMR cells.   CONCLUSION HOXB5 is one of the key factors involved in tumor aggression and progression in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells."
Tamoxifen,COX-2 inhibition,"BACKGROUND Chronic inflammation plays a crucial role in the initiation, promotion, and invasion of tumors, and thus the antiproliferative effects of numerous anti-inflammatory drugs have been frequently reported in the literature. Upregulation of the pro-inflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 has been linked to various human cancers, including breast cancer.   OBJECTIVES This research aims to investigate the antiproliferative activity of different Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs, including COX-2 selective and non-selective agents, against various breast cancer cell lines and to elucidate possible molecular pathways involved in their activity.   METHODS The antiproliferative and combined effects of NSAIDs with raloxifene were evaluated by MTT assay. Cell migration was assessed using a wound-healing assay. The mechanism of cell death was determined using the Annexin V-FITC/ propidium iodide staining flow cytometry method. A mass spectrometry-based targeted metabolomics approach was used to profile the metabolomic changes induced in the T47d cells upon drug treatment.   RESULTS Our results have demonstrated that celecoxib, a potent and selective COX-2 inhibitor, resulted in significant antiproliferative activity against all examined breast cancer cell lines with IC50 values of 95.44, 49.50. and 97.70 M against MDA-MB-231, T47d, and MCF-7, respectively. Additionally, celecoxib exhibited a synergistic effect against T47d cells combined with raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator. Interestingly, celecoxib treatment increased cell apoptosis and resulted in substantial inhibition of cancer cell migration. In addition, the metabolomic analysis suggests that celecoxib may have affected metabolites n = 43 that are involved in several pathways, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle, amino acids metabolism pathways, and energy production pathways in cancer cells.   CONCLUSION Celecoxib may possess potential therapeutic utility for breast cancer treatment as monotherapy or in combination therapy. The reported metabolic changes taking place upon celecoxib treatment may shed light on possible molecular targets mediating the antiproliferative activity of celecoxib in an independent manner of its COX-2 inhibition."
Tamoxifen,estrogen receptor activity,"The estrogenicity of coumestrol, a fluorescent phytoestrogen, has been examined in murine uteri. Coumestrol competed with 17 beta-3Hestradiol for binding to cytoplasmic estrogen receptors, caused cytoplasmic estrogen receptors to associate with chromatin in the nucleus, and induced progesterone receptors. By use of size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography SEHPLC, the interaction of coumestrol with estrogen receptors was examined directly by monitoring the fluorescence associated with macromolecules having properties characteristic of estrogen receptors. These analyses were made possible by the addition of dimethylformamide to the elution buffer, at a concentration 7.5 which improved recoveries but did not interfere with estrogen receptor binding. It was possible to detect fluorescent coumestrol at approximately 0.5 nM. All determinations were performed with preparations in which estrogen receptor activity was 3-10 nM. Exposure of these preparations to coumestrol 50 nM resulted in the elution of increased fluorescent activity in the regions where estrogen receptors eluted during SEHPLC. This fluorescent activity was reduced when diethylstilbestrol, 17 beta-estradiol, hexestrol, or tamoxifen was present as a competitor 2 microM but was unaffected by testosterone or progesterone. Diethylstilbestrol reduced fluorescence below endogenous base lines and thereby displayed a fluorescence quench property which was not observed with other ligands. When hepatic and renal estrogen receptor preparations were used, the injected receptor activity was observed to be the major limiting factor in detecting the interaction of coumestrol with estrogen receptors. These observations are relevant to attempts to visualize estrogen receptors in tumor cells and demonstrate that accepted biochemical criteria for ligand-receptor interaction can be satisfied when fluorescent ligands are examined."
Tamoxifen,EGFR signaling pathway,"BACKGROUND amp OBJECTIVE Tamoxifen TAM is an important endocrine therapeutic drug used in combined treatment for breast cancer. However the drug resistant effect of TAM has become a major concern in clinical use. Epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR is expressed in many tumors and the expression of EGFR in breast cancer tissues is associated with poor prognosis. This study was to investigate EGFR signaling pathway in the drug resistant effect of TAM in breast cancer cells.   METHODS An estrogen receptor ER positive breast cancer cell line, MCF-7 was incubated with TAM 10-7 mol/L for up to 6 months to produce drug resistant cells. mRNA and protein expression of EGFR signaling pathway related genes and ER gene was analyzed by fluorescent quantitation reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction fqRT-PCR and Western blot. AG1478, an EGFR inhibitor, was also used to study the drug resistant effect of TAM.   RESULTS The proliferation of MCF-7 cells was inhibited in the early stage after TAM treatment. However the inhibitory effect vanished after continuous 6-month treatment and the cell proliferation rate returned back to normal. The tolerance of MCF-7 cells to TAM was confirmed by cell growth inhibitory test. In TAM resistant MCF-7 cells, the expression of EGFR mRNA was increased by 4.5 times and the protein expression of EGFR, phosphorylation-extracellular signal-regulated kinase p-ERK1/2 was also increased dramatically Plt0.05. While ER protein expression remained unchanged. Moreover the drug resistant cells were identified more sensitive to AG1478.   CONCLUSION In endocrine therapy, TAM resistant breast cancer cells are likely to be generated by the activation of EGFR signaling pathway after long-term TAM treatment, and EGFR inhibitors might increase the therapeutic effects in breast cancer treatment."
Tamoxifen,estrogen receptor activity,"2,5-oligoadenylate synthetase OAS has been implicated in the effects of interferons INF and steroid hormones on cell growth and differentiation. We studied the combined effects in vitro of hormones and INF on OAS activity in cells from 10 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. IFN enhanced OAS activity in all cells studied and also induced morphologic transformation. Diethylstilbestrol was also found to induce OAS activity, but not morphologic transformation. Progesterone, tamoxifen and dihydrotestosterone had no effect on enzyme activity nor on morphology. In five samples, all with estrogen receptor activity, DES and INF were synergistic in inducing OAS activity. TAM-INF synergism was observed in one sample. DES and TAM did not, however, significantly enhance IFN-induced morphologic transformations. Hydrocortisone reduced OAS activity, and antagonized INF-induced enzyme activity and morphologic transformations. We conclude that hormones can modulate OAS activity in CLL cells. These findings may be of importance in the design of INF-based therapies of CLL."
Tamoxifen,estrogen receptor activity,"A number of metabolic changes within the liver occur concurrent with hepatic regeneration. These processes suggest that the administration of an antiestrogen might alter the rate of hepatic regeneration. To examine this question, male Wistar rats were treated with tamoxifen 0.1 mg/rat/day or 1.0 mg/rat/day or vehicle for three days prior to and after partial hepatectomy, and the anatomic and biochemical process of hepatic regeneration was assessed. Tamoxifen administration caused a dose-dependent decrease in the hepatic cytosolic estrogen receptor activity and, conversely, a dose-dependent increase in cytosolic androgen receptor activity. Despite these changes in baseline hepatic sex steroid receptor status, all receptor activities were comparable between the three groups within 24 hr of partial hepatectomy. Moreover, no differences in any of the parameters assessing hepatic regeneration following partial hepatectomy were evident liver-body ratio, ornithine decarboxylase activity, and thymidine kinase activity. This lack of effect of tamoxifen treatment on hepatic regeneration suggests either that estrogens do not play a role in the modulation of liver growth after partial hepatectomy or that, once initiated, the regenerative process per se determines a series of events that regulate hepatocellular sex hormone receptor status independent of extrahepatic stimuli."
Tamoxifen,COX-2 inhibition,"AIMS To study cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 expression in ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS of the breast and its association with histological features. COX-2, an inducible prostaglandin synthase, has been shown to be important in mammary carcinogenesis, being associated with increased tumour size and unfavourable outcome in breast cancer. Animal studies indicate that COX-2 inhibition is effective in the prevention and treatment of mammary cancers.   METHODS AND RESULTS Fifty-one cases of DCIS diagnosed during 1990-2000 were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry for COX-2 was performed and the COX-2 staining scores were correlated with histological features. The majority of cases 41 of 51 80 had positive COX-2 staining, of which 13 cases 25 had strong staining. High nuclear grade DCIS was significantly associated with increased COX-2 staining P = 0.04.   CONCLUSIONS High-grade lesions are known to be associated with a higher recurrence rate following excision and are often oestrogen receptor negative, and as such, may be less responsive to adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. There is a need to examine further the role of COX-2 expression in DCIS, as both a prognostic and predictive factor."
Tamoxifen,caspase-3 activation,"Cultured cerebellar granule neurons CGC increase survival in a medium containing 25 mM KCl K25, and they die apoptotically when cultures are treated with staurosporine St or are transferred to a 5-mM KCl containing medium K5. Apoptotic CGC show nuclear condensation and caspase-3 activation. Cell death induced by these conditions was partially prevented when cultures were maintained under alkaline conditions, which also induced a marked reduction of the caspase-3 activation. The acidification of the medium further increased cell death induced by both stimuli. Cultures transferred to K5 suffered an immediate intracellular alkalinization that remained constant during the time K5 was present. In contrast, St did not modify cytosolic pH at any of the evaluated times. On the other hand, DIDS, furosemide, and bumetanide prevented CGC death induced by K5 and St. Other drugs such as amiloride, EIPA, tamoxifen, NEM, or NPPB did not modify cell death induced by these conditions. Both DIDS and bumetanide markedly inhibited the processing and activation of caspase-3, and DIDS prevented the nuclear condensation induced by K5 and St. These findings suggest that pH is a condition that could contribute to the modulation of cell death induced by some stimuli and that other ions, such as potassium, could have a role in the initial phase of apoptotic death of CGC."
Tamoxifen,caspase-3 activation,"Pre-clinical trials of novel drugs for the treatment of glioblastoma often use apoptosis as a measure of anti-tumor effect. Presently, there is no single reliable method to determine whether a cell is apoptotic in glioblastoma. The currently used methods for detecting apoptosis, including terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick-end-labeling, nuclear morphology, DNA laddering, Annexin-V binding, and Western blotting, are subjective, difficult to perform or difficult to quantify in glioblastoma. Cytomeric bead array analysis for active caspase-3 is a recently developed technique, which may allow rapid quantitation of apoptosis in glioblastoma. Tamoxifen TAM, a drug used in treating breast cancer and more recently for brain tumors, was used to induce apoptosis in human glioblastoma cell lines. This study showed that TAM induced apoptosis via caspase-3 activation. The results also revealed a time- and dose-dependent response of TAM induced caspase-3 activity in glioblastoma. Cytometric bead array provides a rapid technique for measuring apoptosis and the kinetics of caspase-3 activity in glioblastoma."
Tamoxifen,caspase-3 activation,"Estrogen exerts neuroprotective effects and reduces beta-amyloid accumulation in models of Alzheimers disease AD. A few years ago, a new neuroprotective gene, i.e. seladin-1 for selective AD indicator-1, was identified and found to be down-regulated in AD vulnerable brain regions. Seladin-1 inhibits the activation of caspase-3, a key modulator of apoptosis. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the seladin-1 gene encodes 3beta-hydroxysterol Delta24-reductase, which catalyzes the synthesis of cholesterol from desmosterol. We have demonstrated previously that in fetal neuroepithelial cells, 17beta-estradiol 17betaE2, raloxifene, and tamoxifen exert neuroprotective effects and increase the expression of seladin-1. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether seladin-1 is directly involved in estrogen-mediated neuroprotection. Using the small interfering RNA methodology, significantly reduced levels of seladin-1 mRNA and protein were obtained in fetal neuroepithelial cells. Seladin-1 silencing determined the loss of the protective effect of 17betaE2 against beta-amyloid and oxidative stress toxicity and caspase-3 activation. A computer-assisted analysis revealed the presence of half-palindromic estrogen responsive elements upstream from the coding region of the seladin-1 gene. A 1490-bp region was cloned in a luciferase reporter vector, which was transiently cotransfected with the estrogen receptor alpha in Chinese hamster ovarian cells. The exposure to 17betaE2, raloxifene, tamoxifen, and the soy isoflavones genistein and zearalenone increased luciferase activity, thus suggesting a functional role for the half-estrogen responsive elements of the seladin-1 gene. Our data provide for the first time a direct demonstration that seladin-1 may be considered a fundamental mediator of the neuroprotective effects of estrogen."
Tamoxifen,caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND Drug resistance is a major concern in cancer therapy. Here, we investigate the clinical potential of the second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase Smac/DIABLO in enhancing the apoptosis-inducing potential of commonly used anticancer drugs paclitaxel, doxorubicin, etoposide, tamoxifen, irradiation and TRAIL in breast carcinoma.   METHODS Breast cancer cells were overexpressed with Smac/DIABLO gene full-length or Delta55 Smac/DIABLO or treated with Smac/DIABLO peptide to enhance the apoptosis-inducing potential of chemotherapeutic drugs and irradiation, and sensitize TRAIL-resistant cells. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured by XTT assay and DAPI staining, respectively. Protein-protein interaction was determined by immunoprecipitation followed by the Western blot analysis.   RESULTS Overexpression of Smac/DIABLO gene full-length or Delta55 Smac/DIABLO or treatment with Smac/DIABLO peptide enhances apoptosis induced by paclitaxel, doxorubicin, etoposide, tamoxifen, and irradiation in breast cancer cells. Overexpression of Smac/DIABLO resulted in an increased interaction of Smac/DIABLO with IAPs, which correlated with an increase in caspase-3 activity and apoptosis. Furthermore, Smac/DIABLO sensitized TRAIL-resistant breast cancer cell lines to undergo apoptosis through caspase-3 activation. These data suggest that apoptotic events down-stream of mitochondria were intact in TRAIL-resistant cells since ectopic expression of Smac/DIABLO or pretreatment of cells with Smac/DIABLO peptide completely restored TRAIL sensitivity.   CONCLUSION The ability of Smac/DIABLO agonists to enhance the apoptosis-inducing potential of chemotherapeutic drugs and irradiation, and sensitize TRAIL-resistant tumor cells suggests that Smac/DIABLO may induce fundamental alterations in cell signaling pathways. Thus, Smac/DIABLO agonists can be used as promising new candidates for cancer treatment by potentiating cytotoxic therapies."
Tamoxifen,caspase-3 activation,"The purpose of this study was to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of neuronal death after focal cerebral ischemia and the neuroprotective effects of tamoxifen TMX. The phosphorylation state of 31 protein kinases/signaling proteins and superoxide anion O2- production in the contralateral and ipsilateral cortex was measured after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion pMCAO in ovariectomized rats treated with placebo or TMX. The study revealed that pMCAO modulated the phosphorylation of a number of kinases/proteins in the penumbra at 2 h after pMCAO. Of significant interest, phospho-ERK1/2 pERK1/2 was elevated significantly after pMCAO. TMX attenuated the elevation of pERK1/2, an effect correlated with reduced infarct size. In situ detection of O2- production showed a significant elevation at 1-2 h after pMCAO in the ischemic cortex with enhanced oxidative damage detected at 24 h. ERK activation may be downstream of free radicals, a suggestion supported by the findings that cells positive for O2- had high pERK activation and that a superoxide dismutase SOD mimetic, tempol, significantly attenuated pERK activation after MCAO. TMX treatment significantly reduced the MCAO-induced elevation of O2- production, oxidative damage, and proapoptotic caspase-3 activation. Additionally, pMCAO induced a significant reduction in the levels of manganese SOD MnSOD, which scavenge O2-, an effect largely prevented by TMX treatment, thus providing a potential mechanistic basis for the antioxidant effects of TMX. As a whole, these studies suggest that TMX neuroprotection may be achieved via an antioxidant mechanism that involves enhancement of primarily MnSOD levels, with a corresponding reduction of O2- production, and downstream kinase and caspase-3 activation."
Tetracycline,caspase-3 activation,"Alpha-synuclein -syn is a major component of Lewy bodies found in sporadic and inherited forms of Parkinsons disease PD. Mutations in the gene encoding -syn and duplications and triplications of wild-type WT -syn have been associated with PD. Several mechanisms have been implicated in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in PD, including oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Here we defined the occurrence of oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing WT -syn in a doxycycline Dox regulated manner, before and after exposure to iron 500 M, and determined the changes in proteins involved in the intracellular antioxidant defense system. Data evidenced an increase in caspase-3 activation and diminished reducing capacity of -Dox cells, associated with decreased activity of mitochondria complex I and reduced mitochondrial transcription factor A TFAM levels in these cells. Furthermore, total and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels were higher under basal conditions in cells overexpressing -syn -Dox and this increase was apparently correlated with diminished levels and activities of SOD1 and SOD2 in -Dox cells. Moreover, both reduced and oxidized glutathione levels were diminished in -Dox cells under basal conditions, concomitantly with decreased activity of GCL and reduced protein levels of GCLc. The effects caused by iron 500 M were mostly independent of -syn expression and triggered different antioxidant responses to possibly counterbalance higher levels of free radicals. Overall, data suggest that overexpression of -syn modifies the antioxidant capacity of SH-SY5Y cells due to altered activity and protein levels of SOD1 and SOD2, and decreased glutathione pool."
Tetracycline,caspase-3 activation,"PURPOSE To evaluate the possible role of caspase-3 in retinal photic injury, and to investigate whether minocycline can ameliorate light-induced photoreceptor degeneration.   METHODS Retinal photic injury was induced in rats by exposure to intense light. Expression of caspase-3 was studied using Western blot analysis, immunohistochemical staining and enzyme activity assay. Apoptotic photoreceptor cells were detected by the TdT-dUTP terminal nick-end labeling TUNEL method. Minocycline 15, 30 or 45 mg/kg was administered before or after photic injury in rats randomly assigned to pretreatment and posttreatment groups. Minocycline and vehicle-treated retinas subjected to photic injury were compared with respect to Western blotting, enzyme activity assay, quantitative counts of TUNEL stains, morphometry of the outer nuclear layer ONL thickness and histopathological examination.   RESULTS After light exposure, active caspase-3 and poly-adenosine diphosphate-ribose-polymerase were upregulated in the retinas and increased caspase-3 immunoreactivity was observed in the ONL. Caspase-3 enzyme activity increased in the retinas that underwent photic injury, and this increase was significantly reduced in minocycline pretreated 30 and 45 mg/kg and posttreated 45 mg/kg groups. Intraperitoneal administration of minocycline before or after photic injury in rats also resulted in less TUNEL-positive photoreceptors, as assessed by the quantitative TUNEL counts. The degree of retinal degeneration, measured by the ONL thickness 14 days after photic injury, was significantly improved in minocycline pretreatment 45 mg/kg rats.   CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate that increased caspase-3 activities localize specifically within the ONL after photic injury, and that minocycline partially inhibits caspase-3 activation and photoreceptor degeneration in this animal model."
Tetracycline,caspase-3 activation,"OBJECTIVES We have previously demonstrated that hepatic matrixmetalloproteinase MMP-9 and gelatinase activity increased significantly after sepsis, and pretreatment with chemically modified tetracycline CMT-3 inhibited these expressions and improved survivability. It has been established that MMP-9 release from hepatic nonparenchymal cells activates transforming growth factor TGF-beta1, which in turn catalyzes the conversion of procaspase-8 into active caspase-8. Caspase-8 activates caspase-3, which in turn degrades fibronectin and focal adhesion kinase and leads to disruption of hepatic architecture and integrity. We have been interested in investigating the role of posttreatment with CMT-3 on hepatic MMP-9, TGF-beta1, and caspase-3 activity following sepsis.   DESIGN Laboratory experiment.   SETTING University laboratory.   SUBJECTS Male Sprague-Dawley rats.   INTERVENTIONS In this study, sepsis was induced in rats by cecal ligation and puncture CLP, and 2 hrs later, half of the rats received CMT-3 25 mg/kg, whereas the other half received vehicle by gavage. Twenty-four and 48 hrs after sepsis induction, blood and liver samples were collected.   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Plasma glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase GOT and glutamic pyruvic transaminase GPT levels were determined by enzymatic method, and the activation states of hepatic MMP-9, MMP-2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase TIMP-1, TGF-beta1, and caspase-3 were determined by Western immunoblotting. Plasma GOT, GPT, and hepatic MMP-9 activity increased 2.5-fold, and TFG-beta1 and caspase-3 activity increased 1.5- to 2-fold at 24 hrs and 48 hrs post-CLP CMT-3 treatment blocked these increases. Furthermore, CMT-3 treatment also led to increased TIMP-1 level, an in vivo inhibitor of MMP-9. MMP-2 level was unaffected by CLP. The 24-hr and 48-hr mortality rates for CLP rats were 29 and 50, whereas posttreatment with CMT-3 resulted in 0 mortality.   CONCLUSIONS Our results are consistent with an MMP-9-induced caspase-3 activation in response to CLP. CMT-3 posttreatment increased TIMP-1 level and thereby inhibited MMP-9, which in turn decreased TGF-beta1 and caspase-3 signaling pathways and improved survivability in septic rats."
Tetracycline,caspase-3 activation,"Transforming growth factor TGF-beta1 is an essential regulatory cytokine that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diverse facets of the injury and repair responses in the lung. The types of responses that it elicits can be appreciated in studies from our laboratory that demonstrated that the transgenic Tg overexpression of TGF-beta1 in the murine lung causes epithelial apoptosis followed by fibrosis, inflammation, and parenchymal destruction. Because a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21, is a key regulator of apoptosis, we hypothesized that p21 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of TGF-beta1-induced tissue responses. To test this hypothesis we evaluated the effect of TGF-beta1 on the expression of p21 in the murine lung. We also characterized the effects of transgenic TGF-beta1 in mice with wild-type and null mutant p21 loci. These studies demonstrate that TGF-beta1 is a potent stimulator of p21 expression in the epithelial cells and macrophages in the murine lung. They also demonstrate that TGF-beta1-induced lung inflammation, fibrosis, myofibroblast accumulation, and alveolar destruction are augmented in the absence of p21, and that these alterations are associated with exaggerated levels of apoptosis and caspase-3 activation. Finally, our studies further demonstrated that TGF-beta1 induces p21 via a TNF-alpha-signaling pathway and that p21 is a negative modulator of TGF-beta1-induced TNF-alpha expression. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that p21 regulates TGF-beta1-induced apoptosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and alveolar remodeling by interacting with TNF-alpha-signaling pathways."
Tetracycline,caspase-3 activation,"We investigated mechanisms of cytotoxicity induced by doxycycline doxy and minocycline mino in the chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cell line. Doxy and mino induced cell death in exposure-dependent manner. While annexin V/propidium iodide staining was consistent with apoptosis, the morphological changes in Giemsa staining were more equivocal. A pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK partially reverted cell death morphology, but concurrently completely prevented PARP cleavage. Mitochondrial involvement was detected as dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome C release. DNA double strand breaks detected with H2AX antibody and caspase-2 activation were found early after the treatment start, but caspase-3 activation was a late event. Decrement of Bcl-xL protein levels and electrophoretic shift of Bcl-xL molecule were induced by both drugs. Phosphorylation of Bcl-xL at serine 62 was ruled out. Similarly, Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase levels were decreased. Lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine restored Bcl-xL and Bcr/Abl protein levels and inhibited caspase-3 activation. Thus, the cytotoxicity of doxy and mino in K562 cells is mediated by DNA damage, Bcl-xL deamidation and lysosomal degradation with activation of mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis."
Tetracycline,caspase-3 activation,"Intracranial hemorrhage in preterm neonates may result in neonatal mortality and functional disabilities, but its pathogenic mechanisms are poorly defined and better therapies are needed. We used a tetracycline-regulated transgenic system to test whether the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF in the germinal matrix leads to intracranial hemorrhage. This genetic strategy initially induced a dense network of loosely adjoined endothelial cells and pericytes near lateral ventricles, similar to the immature vascular rete in human fetal brains. Yet, this rich vascular network transformed into low-vasculature patches correlated with hemorrhage and caspase-3 activation near birth. Gene expression and biochemical analyses suggested that downstream mediators of VEGF in this network include transcriptional factors ETS1 and HIF2 hypoxia-inducible factor 2, components of the PDGF platelet-derived growth factor  and TGF transforming growth factor- receptor signaling pathways, matrix metalloproteinase-9 MMP-9, and cathepsins. Prenatal administration of glucocorticoids markedly reduced mortality and cerebral hemorrhage in mutant animals, as in human neonates. This protective effect was not due to blocking vasculogenesis, but was instead associated with inhibition of neurovascular proteases, notably MMP-9, cathepsin B, and caspase-3. Collectively, these results support a causative role of VEGF in perinatal cerebral hemorrhage and implicate its downstream proteases as potential therapeutic targets."
Tetracycline,caspase-3 activation,"We previously demonstrated that alkyl gallates coupled to triphenylphosphine have a selective and efficient antiproliferative effect by inducing mitochondrial uncoupling in vitro due to the increased mitochondrial transmembrane potential of tumor cells. Therefore, in this work, the in vivo antitumor activities of alkyl gallate triphenylphosphonium derivatives TPPC8, TPPC10 and TPPC12 were evaluated in a syngeneic murine model of breast cancer. We found that TPPC10 increased the cytosolic ADP/ATP ratio and significantly increased the AMP levels in a concentration-dependent manner in TA3/Ha murine mammary adenocarcinoma cells. Interestingly, TPPC10 induced a decrease in the levels of cellular proliferation markers and promoted caspase-3 activation in tumor-bearing mice. Additionally, TPPC10 inhibited tumor growth in the syngeneic mouse model. Importantly, 30days of intraperitoneal i.p. administration of the combination of TPPC10 10mg/kg/48h and the antibiotic doxycycline 10mg/kg/24h completely eliminated the subcutaneous tumor burden in mice n=6, without any relapses at 60days post-treatment. This enhancement of the individual activities of TPPC10 and doxycycline is due to the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation by TPPC10 and the inhibition of mitochondrial biogenesis by doxycycline, as demonstrated by loss of mitochondrial mass and overexpression of PGC1- as an adaptive response. Moreover, i.p. administration of TPPC10 10mg/kg/24h to healthy mice did not produce toxicity or damage in organs important for drug metabolism and excretion, as indicated by hematological, biochemical and histological assessments. These findings suggest that the combination of TPPC10 with doxycycline is a valuable candidate therapy for breast cancer management."
Tetracycline,caspase-3 activation,"Considering that several pathways leading to cell death are activated in cerebral ischemia, we tested in mouse models of transient and permanent ischemia a drug cocktail aiming at distinct pharmacological targets during the evolution of ischemic injury. It consists of minocycline--an antibiotic with anti-inflammatory properties, riluzole--a glutamate antagonist, and nimodipine--a blocker of voltage-gated calcium channels. Administered 2 h after transient or permanent MCAO, it significantly decreased the size of infarction, by approximately 65 after transient and approximately 35 after permanent ischemia and markedly improve clinical recovery of mice. In both experimental models a three-drug cocktail achieved significantly more efficient neuroprotection than any of the components tested alone. However, some interesting observation emerged from the single-drug studies. Treatment with minocycline alone was efficient in both experimental models while treatment with glutamate antagonist riluzole conferred neuroprotection only after transient MCAO. Immunohistochemical analysis following three-drug treatment revealed reduced microglia/macrophages and caspase-3 activation as well as preserved GFAP immunoreactivity following transient ischemia. No detectable differences in the levels of Mac-2, GFAP and caspase-3 immunoreactivities were observed 72 h after permanent MCAO. These marked differences in the brain tissue responses to ischemic injury and to treatments suggest that different pathological mechanisms may be operating in transient and permanent ischemia. However, the three-drug cocktail exerted significant neuroprotection in both experimental models thus demonstrating that simultaneous targeting of several pathophysiological pathways involved in the evolution of ischemic injury may represent a rational therapeutic strategy for stroke."
Tetracycline,caspase-3 activation,"The aims of this study were to assess that the effects of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells BMSCs combination with minocycline improve spinal cord injury SCI in rat model. In the present study, the Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups control group, SCI group, BMSCs group, Minocycline group and BMSCs  minocycline group. Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan BBB test and MPO activity were used to assess the effect of combination therapy on locomotion and neutrophil infiltration. Inflammation factors, VEGF and BDNF expression, caspase-3 activation, phosphorylation-p38MAPK, proNGF, p75NTR and RhoA expressions were estimated using commercial kits or western blot, respectively. BBB scores were significantly increased and MPO activity was significantly undermined by combination therapy. In addition, combination therapy significantly decreased inflammation factors in SCI rats. Results from western blot showed that combination therapy significantly up-regulated the protein of VEGF and BDNF expression and down-regulated the protein of phosphorylation-p38MAPK, proNGF, p75NTR and RhoA expressions in SCI rats. Combination therapy stimulation also suppressed the caspase-3 activation in SCI rats. These results demonstrated that the effects of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells combination with minocycline improve SCI in rat model."
Tetracycline,caspase-3 activation,"This study aimed to elucidate the protective effect of minocycline against streptomycin-induced damage of cochlear hair cells and its mechanism. Cochlear membranes were isolated from newborn Wistar rats and randomly divided into control, 500mol/L streptomycin, 100mol/L minocycline, and streptomycin and minocycline treatment groups. Hair cell survival was analyzed by detecting the expression of 3-nitrotyrosine 3-NT in cochlear hair cells by immunofluorescence and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of 3-NT and inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS, and poly ADP-Ribose polymerase PARP and caspase-3 activation were evaluated by western blotting. The results demonstrated hair cell loss at 24h after streptomycin treatment. No change was found in supporting cells of the cochleae. Minocycline pretreatment improved hair cell survival and significantly reduced the expression of iNOS and 3-NT in cochlear tissues compared with the streptomycin treatment group. PARP and caspase-3 activation was increased in the streptomycin treatment group compared with the control group, and pretreatment with minocycline decreased cleaved PARP and activated caspase-3 expression. Minocycline protected cochlear hair cells from injury caused by streptomycin in vitro. The mechanism underlying the protective effect may be associated with the inhibition of excessive formation of nitric oxide, reduction of the nitration stress reaction, and inhibition of PARP and caspase-3 activation in cochlear hair cells. Combined minocycline therapy can be applied to patients requiring streptomycin treatment."
Tetracycline,caspase-3 activation,"Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders FASD are caused by ethanol exposure during the pregnancy and is the leading cause of mental retardation. Ethanol exposure during the development results in the loss of neurons in the developing brain, which may underlie many neurobehavioral deficits associated with FASD. It is important to understand the mechanisms underlying ethanol-induced neuronal loss and develop appropriate therapeutic strategies. One of the potential mechanisms involves neuroimmune activation. Using a third trimester equivalent mouse model of ethanol exposure, we demonstrated that ethanol induced a wide-spread neuroapoptosis, microglial activation, and neuroinflammation in C57BL/6 mice. Minocycline is an antibiotic that inhibits microglial activation and alleviates neuroinflammation. We tested the hypothesis that minocycline may protect neurons ethanol-induced neuron death by inhibiting microglial activation and neuroinflammation. We showed that minocycline significantly inhibited ethanol-induced caspase-3 activation, microglial activation, and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, minocycline reversed ethanol inhibition of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Minocycline blocked ethanol-induced activation of GSK3, a key mediator of neuroinflammation and microglial activation in the developing brain. Consistent with the in vivo observations, minocycline inhibited ethanol-induced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of GSK3 in a microglia cell line SIM-9. GSK3 inhibitor eliminated ethanol activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in SIM-9 cells. Co-cultures of cortical neurons and SIM-9 microglia cells sensitized neurons to alcohol-induced neuronal death. Minocycline protected neurons against ethanol-induced neuronal death in neurons/microglia co-cultures. Together, these results suggest that minocycline may ameliorate ethanol neurotoxicity in the developing by alleviating GSK3-mediated neuroinflammation."
Tetracycline,COX-2 inhibition,"The role of cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 in cardiovascular biology remains controversial. Although COX-2 has been reported to mediate the protective actions of late preconditioning, other studies show that it is also an important mediator of inflammation, toxic shock, and apoptosis, resulting in significant dysfunction and injury in several tissues. To determine whether increased myocardial COX-2, in itself, is protective, cardiac-specific, inducible Tet-off COX-2 transgenic iCOX-2 TG mice were generated by crossbreeding -MyHC-tTA transgenic mice tetracycline transactivator tTA with CMV/TRE-COX-2 transgenic mice. Three months after COX-2 induction, mice were subjected to a 30-min coronary occlusion and 24 h of reperfusion. Three different lines L5, L7, and L8 of iCOX-2 TG mice were studied in all three lines, infarct size was markedly reduced compared with WT mice L5 TG/TG 23.4  5.8 vs. WT/WT 48.5  6.1 of risk region L7 TG/TG 23.2  6.2 vs. WT/WT 53.3  3.6 and L8 TG/TG 23.5  2.8 vs. WT/WT 52.7  4.6 P lt 0.05 for each. COX-2 inhibition with NS-398 completely abolished the cardioprotection provided by COX-2 overexpression. This study for the first time utilizes an inducible cardiac-specific COX-2 overexpression system to examine the role of this enzyme in ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo. We demonstrate that induced cardiac-specific overexpression of COX-2 exerts a potent cardioprotective effect against myocardial infarction in mice, and that chronic COX-2 overexpression is not associated with any apparent deleterious effects. We also show that PGE2 levels are upregulated in COX-2 overexpressing cardiac tissue, confirming increased enzyme activity. Finally, we have developed a valuable genetic tool to further our understanding of the role of COX-2 in ischemia/reperfusion injury and other settings. The concept that COX-2 is chronically protective has important therapeutic implications for studies of long-term gene therapy aimed at increasing myocardial COX-2 content as well as other COX-2- based strategies."
Tetracycline,caspase-3 activation,"Alzheimers disease AD is characterized by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated, aggregated tau protein and extracellular deposits of beta-amyloid peptide. Increased beta-amyloid levels are thought to precede tangle formation, but tau pathology is more closely related to neuronal death. Minocycline, a tetracycline derivative, has potent antiinflammatory, antiapoptotic, and neuroprotective effects in several models of neurodegenerative disease, including models of AD with amyloid pathology. We have used both in vitro and in vivo models of AD to determine whether minocycline may have therapeutic efficacy against tau pathology. In primary cortical neurons, minocycline prevents beta-amyloid-induced neuronal death, reduces caspase-3 activation, and lowers generation of caspase-3-cleaved tau fragments. Treatment of tangle-forming transgenic mice htau line with minocycline results in reduced levels of tau phosphorylation and insoluble tau aggregates. The in vivo effects of minocycline are also associated with reduced caspase-3 activation and lowered tau cleavage by caspase-3. In tau mice, we find that conformational changes in tau are susceptible to minocycline treatment, but are not directly associated with the amount of tau fragments produced, highlighting a dissociation between the development of these pathological tau species. These results suggest a possible novel therapeutic role for minocycline in the treatment of AD and related tauopathies."
Tetracycline,caspase-3 activation,"Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia HI is a major contributor to many neurological, psychiatric and behavioral disorders. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that a one-time dose of doxycycline DOXY, even when given 3h after HI insult, was neuroprotective and significantly reduced microglial activation and cleaved caspase-3 protein expression in the immature brain. In light of these data, the goal of this study was to investigate the effects of DOXY administration on amino acid neurotransmitters. Post-natal-day 7 rats received DOXY 10mg/kg or vehicle VEH concomitant with the onset of HI, and were euthanized 30 min, 1, 2 or 4h post-HI ngtor=6. Extracted brains were either immediately dissected for frontal cortex, striatum and hippocampal regions, or removed in their entirety and flash frozen in isopentane for histological analyses. Dissected regions were homogenized and aliquots were prepared for high performance liquid chromatography HPLC analyses of amino acid levels and brain levels of DOXY. HPLC extraction revealed that systemic administration of DOXY resulted in mean drug levels of 867.1/-376.1 ng/g of brain tissue. Histological analyses revealed microglial activation, caspase-3 activation and neuronal degeneration consistent with a mild injury in the regions most vulnerable to HI. We found that HI caused significant, time-dependent, regional changes in brain amino acids including glutamate, GABA, alanine, aspartate, asparagine, serine, glutamine, glycine and taurine. HI significantly increased glutamate levels in the hippocampus HIVEH=15.8/-3.1 ng/microg versus control=11.8/-1.4 ng/microg protein 4h post-HI plt0.05. Pups treated with DOXY had lower glutamate levels 13.1/-2.4 ng/microg when compared to VEH-treated pups 15.8/-3.1 ng/microg, however these values failed to reach significance. In addition, DOXY-treated pups had significantly lower alanine HIVEH=1.1/-0.2 ng/microg versus HIDOXY=0.50.1 ng/microg and serine HIVEH=1.4/-0.4 ng/microg versus HIDOXY=0.70.1 ng/microg levels in the hippocampus, 4h post-HI. Similar normalizations and significant reductions in alanine and serine were seen in the cortex and striatum. These results show that in addition to its previously reported and well-documented anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties, DOXY has significant effects on amino acid neurotransmitters."
Tetracycline,COX-2 inhibition,"The oncogenic hepatitis B virus X protein HBx and cyclooxygenase COX-2 are highly co-expressed in chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma HCC. Although HBx is shown to activate COX-2, the functional consequences of this interaction in hepatocarcinogenesis remain unknown. Using an engineered hepatoma cell system in which the expression of wild-type p53 can be chemically modulated, we show here that COX-2 mediates HBx actions in opposing p53. Enforced expression of HBx sequestrates p53 in the cytoplasm and significantly abolishes p53-induced apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein is suppressed by p53 but reactivated by HBx. The abrogation of apoptosis is completely reversed by specific COX-2 inhibition, suggesting that HBx blocks p53-induced apoptosis via activation of COX-2/PGE2 pathway. We further show that COX-2 inhibition blocks HBx reactivation of Mcl-1, linking this protein to the anti-apoptotic function of COX-2. These results demonstrate that COX-2 is an important survival factor mediating the oncogenic actions of HBx. Over-expression of HBx and COX-2 may provide a selective clonal advantage for preneoplastic or neoplastic hepatocytes and contribute to the initiation and progression of HCC."
Tetracycline,EGFR signaling pathway,"Although lung cancer patients harboring EGFR mutations benefit from treatment with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors EGFR-TKI, most of them rapidly relapse. RHOB GTPase is a critical player in both lung carcinogenesis and the EGFR signaling pathway therefore, we hypothesized that it could play a role in the response to EGFR-TKI In a series of samples from EGFR-mutated patients, we found that low RHOB expression correlated with a good response to EGFR-TKI treatment while a poor response correlated with high RHOB expression 15.3 versus 5.6 months of progression-free survival. Moreover, a better response to EGFR-TKI was associated with low RHOB levels in a panel of lung tumor cell lines and in a lung-specific tetracycline-inducible EGFRL858R transgenic mouse model. High RHOB expression was also found to prevent erlotinib-induced AKT inhibition in vitro and in vivo Furthermore, a combination of the new-generation AKT inhibitor G594 with erlotinib induced tumor cell death in vitro and tumor regression in vivo in RHOB-positive cells. Our results support a role for RHOB/AKT signaling in the resistance to EGFR-TKI and propose RHOB as a potential predictor of patient response to EGFR-TKI treatment."
Tetracycline,caspase-3 activation,"Arsenic trioxide, an acute promyelocytic leukemia chemotherapeutic, may be an efficacious treatment for other cancers. Understanding the mechanism as well as genetic and molecular characteristics associated with sensitivity to arsenite-induced cell death is key to providing effective chemotherapeutic usage of arsenite. Arsenite sensitivity correlates with deficient p53 pathways in multiple cell lines. The role of p53 in preventing arsenite-induced mitotic arrest-associated apoptosis MAAA, a form of mitotic catastrophe, was examined in TR9-7 cells, a model cell line with p53 exogenously regulated in a tetracycline-off expression system. Arsenite activated G1 and G2 cell cycle checkpoints independently of p53, but mitotic catastrophe occurred preferentially in p53- cells. Cyclin B/CDC2CDK1 stabilization and caspase-3 activation persisted in arsenite-treated p53- cells consistent with MAAA/mitotic catastrophe. N-Benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone, a pan-caspase inhibitor, completely abolished arsenite-induced MAAA/mitotic catastrophe and greatly increased the mitotic index. WEE1 and p21CIP1/WAF1 inhibit cyclin B/CDC2 by CDC2 tyrosine-15 phosphorylation and direct binding, respectively. CDC2-Y15-P was transiently elevated in arsenite-treated p53 cells but persisted in p53- cells. Arsenite induced p53-S15-P and p21CIP1/WAF1 only in p53 cells. P21CIP1/WAF1-siRNA-treated p53 cells were similar to p53- cells in mitotic index and cell cycle protein levels. p53-inducible proteins GADD45alpha and 14-3-3sigma are capable of inhibiting cyclin B/CDC2 but did not play a p53-dependent role in mitotic escape in TR9-7 cells. The data indicate that p53 mediates cyclin B/CDC2 inactivation and mitotic release directly via p21CIP1/WAF1 induction."
Tetracycline,caspase-3 activation,"It has been reported that expression of Bax by Tet-On system induces apoptosis in Jurkat cells. The parental Jurkat cells have mutation of Bax gene and do not express Bax protein. Wild-type Bax-bearing cells express endogenous Bax protein and it is still unclear whether overexpression of Bax alone can sufficiently induce apoptosis in these cells in the absence of any cytotoxic stimulus. To investigate this, wild-type Bax-bearing K562 cells were transfected with Tet-On Bax-inducible system pTet-On and pTRE-Bax plasmids, and Bax-inducible stable cell lines were established. Overexpression of Bax in wild-type Bax-bearing K562 cells without any cyctotoxic signal resulted in increase of apoptotic cells, caspase-3 activation, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, and mitochondrial membrane potential change. Western blotting and confocal microscopy revealed that overexpression of Bax was detected in mitochondria. A pancaspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk, which has no effect on mitochondrial cytochrome c release and mitochondrial membrane potential change inhibited the apoptotic events in the presence of overexpressed Bax in mitochondria. These findings suggest that Bax protein, when present above a threshold level, is sufficient to trigger an apoptosis cascade, and its initiation requires simultaneous caspase activation probably not mediated by mitochondrial cytochrome c release and mitochondrial membrane potential change in K562 cells."
Tetracycline,caspase-3 activation,"Activated caspase-3 is considered an important enzyme in the cell death pathway. To study the specific role of caspase-3 activation in neuronal cells, we generated a stable tetracycline-regulated SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cell line, which expressed a highly efficient self-activating chimeric caspase-3, consisting of the caspase-1 prodomain fused to the caspase-3 catalytic domain. Under expression-inducing conditions, we observed a time-dependent increase of processed caspase-3 by immunostaining for the active form of the enzyme, intracellular caspase-3 enzyme activity, as well as polyADP-ribose polymerase PARP cleavage. Induced expression of the caspase fusion protein showed predominantly caspase-3 activity without any apoptotic morphological changes. In contrast, staurosporine treatment of the same cells resulted in activation of multiple caspases and profound apoptotic morphology. Our work provides evidence that auto-activation of caspase-3 can be efficiently achieved with a longer prodomain and that neuronal cell apoptosis may require another caspase or activation of multiple caspase enzymes."
Tetracycline,caspase-3 activation,"The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and putative mechanisms of action of tetracycline and minocycline in inhibiting retinal cell apoptosis after glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and trophic factor deprivation in a retinal cell line E1A-NR.3 and in primary mixed retinal cell cultures. In addition, a differentiated PC-12 cell line was used to determine whether minocycline was neuroprotective after trophic withdrawal in a pure neuronal cell line devoid of glia. Results from this study demonstrated that minocycline, but not tetracycline, is protective in in vitro models of excitotoxicity-induced retinal cell apoptosis. Moreover, the protective effects provided by minocycline in retinal cells seemed independent of actions on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors NMDARs and glutamate receptor-mediated Ca2 influx. Doses of the NMDAR antagonist MK-801 dizocilpine and minocycline that alone provided no significant neuroprotection resulted in enhanced retinal cell survival when applied concurrently, suggestive of distinct signaling pathways, and minocycline was without effect on glutamate-induced Ca2 influx, as assessed by calcium imaging. Minocycline was also neuroprotective after trophic factor withdrawal, producing a decrease in apoptosis and caspase-3 activation in both retinal cells and the PC-12 neuronal-like cell line. These results support a role for minocycline as a retinal neuroprotectant and demonstrate that the antiapoptotic actions of minocycline in retinal cells do not arise from the blockage of NMDARs or glutamate receptor-mediated Ca2 influx but do involve inhibition of caspase-3 activation. In addition, the survival-promoting actions of minocycline may arise via actions on both neuronal and non-neuronal cell targets."
Tetracycline,caspase-3 activation,"Developmental exposure to ethanol may cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders FASD, and the immature central nervous system CNS is particularly vulnerable to ethanol. In addition to vulnerability in the developing brain, we previously showed that ethanol also caused neuroapoptosis, microglial activation, and neuroinflammation in the spinal cord. Minocycline is an antibiotic that inhibits microglial activation and alleviates neuroinflammation. We sought to determine whether minocycline could protect spinal cord neurons against ethanol-induced damage. In this study, we showed that minocycline significantly inhibited ethanol-induced caspase-3 activation, microglial activation, and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the developing spinal cord. Moreover, minocycline blocked ethanol-induced activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta GSK3, a key regulator of microglial activation. Meanwhile, minocycline significantly restored ethanol-induced inhibition of protein kinase B AKT, mammalian target of the rapamycin mTOR, and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, which were important pro-survival signaling pathways for neurons. Together, minocycline may attenuate ethanol-induced damage to the developing spinal cord by inhibiting microglial activation/neuroinflammation and by restoring the pro-survival signaling."
Tetracycline,caspase-3 activation,"Transthyretin Leu55Pro is one of the most aggressive mutations in familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by extracellular deposition of fibrillar amyloid protein. This variant has the ability to form fibrils in vitro under physiological conditions PBS, pH 7.4. We studied by transmission electron microscopy the effect of the drug 4-iodo-4-deoxydoxorubicin I-DOX on the in vitro assembly of TTR Leu55Pro fibrils by following fibril growth over a 15 day period. Our results showed that I-DOX at a concentration of 10-5 M/100 microg fibrils does not inhibit fibril formation in up to 10 days since fibrils identical to the ones present in the untreated sample were observed. However, after 15 days of treatment, only round particles, resembling soluble native TTR, were observed. We also tested the ability of tetracyclines and nitrophenols to interfere with amyloid fibril formation for 17 days the group of compounds tested showed fibril disruption activity to different extents doxycycline and 2,4-dinitrophenol resulted in complete disaggregation of fibrils. The species generated upon I-DOX and tetracyclines treatments were nontoxic, as revealed by the lack of significant caspase-3 activation on a Schwannoma cell line, making them potential therapeutic drugs in TTR-related and other amyloidosis."
Tetracycline,caspase-3 activation,"Recently we have shown that galanin binding significantly correlates with survival in neuroblastoma patients, indicating a possible modulatory role of galanin receptors in neuroblastic tumor biology. However, the molecular mechanisms beyond this correlation have not been elucidated. Here, the cellular effects on activation of specific galanin receptor subtypes in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were analyzed using a tetracycline-controlled expression system. Pharmacological studies confirmed the inducible expression of high affinity binding sites for galanin in SH-SY5Y cells transfected with the galanin receptors GalR1 SY5Y/GalR1 and GalR2 SY5Y/GalR2. Microphysiometry revealed that both receptor subtypes were able to mediate an intracellular signal upon galanin application. Interestingly, induction of receptor expression and treatment with 100 nm galanin resulted in a dramatic decrease in cell viability in SY5Y/GalR2 cells 93 /- 3 compared with a less pronounced effect in SY5Y/GalR1 cells 19 /- 10. The antiproliferative potency of galanin was 100-fold higher in SY5Y/GalR2 50 effective concentration, 1.1 nm than in SY5Y/GalR1 cells 50 effective concentration, 190 nm. Furthermore, activation of receptor expression and exposure to galanin resulted in apparent morphological changes indicative of apoptosis in SY5Y/GalR2 cells only. Induction of cell death by the apoptotic process was confirmed by poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase cleavage, caspase-3 activation, and the typical laddering of DNA. This study indicates that a high level of GalR2 expression is able to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells and therefore identifies GalR2 as a possible target for pharmacological intervention in neuroblastoma."
Tetracycline,caspase-3 activation,"Overexpression of the receptor tyrosine kinase HER-2/neu is associated with poor prognosis in patients with breast and ovarian cancer. Recent excitement has surrounded the therapeutic effects of HER-2-blocking therapy strategies and has rekindled interest on the molecular mechanisms of HER-2/neu in tumor biology. To study the role of HER-2/neu overexpression in vivo, we used a murine fibroblast cell line NIH3T3-her2 conditionally expressing human HER-2/neu under control of a tetracycline-responsive promoter. Expression of HER-2 could be down-regulated below detection limit gt625-fold dilution by exposure of NIH3T3-her2 cells to anhydrotetracycline ATc. Subcutaneous injection of NIH3T3-her2 cells into nude mice resulted in rapid tumor growth. Mice with mean tumor volumes of 0.2, 0.8, 1.9, and 14.9 cm3 were treated daily with 10 mg/kg ATc to switch off HER-2/neu expression, producing reductions in tumor size of 100, 98.1, 81.4, and 74.2, respectively, by 7 days after onset of ATc administration P = 0.005, Kruskal-Wallis test. Different long-term effects of HER-2 down-regulation were observed when mice with small 0.2 cm3 n = 7, intermediate 0.8-1.2 cm3 n = 10 and large gt or =1.9 cm3 n = 11 tumors received ATc for up to 40 days. Complete remission was observed for 100, 40, and 18 of the small-, intermediate-, and large-sized tumors, respectively P = 0.003. However, after 20-45 days of ATc administration, recurrent tumor growth was observed for all mice, even in those with previous complete remissions. The time periods for which mean tumor volume could be suppressed to volumes lt0.1 cm3 under ATc administration were 34, 22, 8, and 0 days for tumors with initial volumes of 0.2, 0.8, 1.9 and 14.9 cm3, respectively P = 0.005, Kruskal-Wallis test. Interestingly, HER-2 remained below the detection limit in recurrent tumor tissue, suggesting that initially HER-2-dependent tumors switched to HER-2 independence. The ""second hits"" leading to HER-2-independent tumor growth have not yet been identified. The rapid regression of tumors after down-regulation of HER-2 was explained by two independent mechanisms a a block in cell cycle progression, as evidenced by a decrease in Ki-67 antigen expression from 40 before ATc treatment to 8.3 after 7 days of ATc treatment and b induction of apoptosis as demonstrated by caspase-3 activation and by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase Tdt-mediated nick end labeling assay TUNEL. In conclusion, we have shown that switching off HER-2 may disturb the sensitive balance between cell proliferation and cell death, leading to apoptosis and tumor remission. Tumor remission was dependent on the volume of the tumors before down-regulation of HER-2/neu."
Valproic acid,caspase-3 activation,"Burn injury may result in multiple organ dysfunction partially because of apoptotic cell death. The authors have previously shown that valproic acid VPA improves survival in a dog burn model. The aim of this study is to examine whether a VPA improves survival in a rodent burn model and whether this was because of inhibition of cell apoptosis. Rats were subjected to third-degree 55 TBSA burns and randomized to treatment with a VPA 300 mg/kg or normal saline. One group of animals was monitored for 12 hours for survival analysis another group was killed at 6 hours after injury, and brains, hearts, and blood samples were harvested for examination. Plasma creatine kinase CK-MB activities and neuron-specific enolase NSE levels were measured to evaluate the cardiac and brain damages. The effects of a VPA on acetylation of histone H3 and caspase-3 activation were also evaluated. Major burn injury resulted in a significant decrease in the acetylation of histone H3, and there was an increase in plasma CK-MB activities, NSE concentrations, and tissue levels of activated caspase-3. A VPA treatment significantly increased the acetylation of histone H3 and survival of the animals after major burn injury. In addition, a VPA treatment significantly attenuated the plasma CK-MB activities, an NSE concentrations, and inhibited caspase-3 activation after major burn injury. These results indicate that a VPA can attenuate cardiac and brain injury, and can improve survival in a rodent model of lethal burn injury. These protective effects may be mediated in part through the inhibition of caspase-3 activation."
Valproic acid,caspase-3 activation,"Valproic acid VPA, a widely prescribed drug for seizures and bipolar disorder, induces apoptosis in microglia, but the underlying mechanism by which microglia apoptosis in response to VPA is not yet known. In this study, we found that the mitochondrial pathway played an important role in VPA-induced apoptosis in both BV-2 microglia and mouse primary microglial cells. In addition, VPA increased the level of phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK, but had no effects on phospho-ERK and phospho-JNK MAPKs. Moreover, p38 inhibitor SB203580 strongly inhibited VPA-induced apoptosis and caspase-3 activation. Taken together, our results clearly demonstrated that VPA could induce apoptosis of microglia via p38 MAPK and mitochondrial apoptosis pathway."
Valproic acid,caspase-3 activation,"Valproic acid VPA is an established drug in the long-term therapy of seizure disorders. Recently, VPA has been associated with anticancer activity, an effect thought to be mediated through the inhibition of cellular histone deacetylase 1. We investigated the effect of various doses of VPA 0, 1.2, and 5.0 mmol/L administered either acutely or chronically on histone acetylation, p21 gene expression, androgen receptor expression, prostate-specific antigen PSA expression, and cell survival and proliferation in prostate cancer cell lines. We also studied the effect of chronic VPA on tumor xenograft growth in vivo. Our results show that acute treatment 3 days VPA can increase net histone H3 acetylation and up-regulate p21, AR, and cytosolic PSA expression. Interestingly, the effects on AR and PSA are reversed with chronic treatment. In addition, acute VPA reduces cell survival but has no effect on the subsequent proliferation of surviving cells following drug withdrawal. However, when VPA is chronically administered 10-14 days to prostate cancer cells, even lower doses of VPA result in marked decreases in the net proliferation rate, correlating with increased caspase-2 and caspase-3 activation. These effects are evident in both androgen receptor-positive LNCaP and C4-2 and androgen receptor-negative DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells. Moreover, chronic VPA treatment results in statistically significant reduction of tumor xenograft growth in vivo. We conclude that acute treatment has nominal effects on prostate cancer cell survival and proliferation, but chronic VPA results in profound decreases in proliferation, independently of androgen regulation."
Valproic acid,caspase-3 activation,"OBJECTIVE To observe the effect of sodium valproate VPA on the proliferation and apoptosis of human lung carcinoma SPC-A1 cells and the underlying mechanism.   METHODS The effect of VPA on the proliferation of SPC-A1 cells was evaluated by MTT assay and clone formation assay. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the apoptosis of the cells exposed to VPA. The changes in the expressions of Bcl-xl, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, caspase-9, and caspase-3 in the exposed cells were detected by Western blotting.   RESULTS Incubation with VPA for 48 h resulted in a significant inhibition of SPC-A1 cell proliferation, with a IC50 of 1.8 mmol/L. VPA treatment also inhibited cell colony formation and induced obvious cell apoptosis. Exposure to 8 mmol/L VPA for 48 h caused a percentage of early apoptotic cells of 60.44. VPA treatment at different concentrations for 48 h obviously lowered the protein levels of Bcl-xl, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 and induced caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation in SPC-A1 cells.   CONCLUSION VPA can inhibit the proliferation of SPC-A1 cells by triggering mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis."
Valproic acid,caspase-3 activation,"BACKGROUND We have demonstrated that valproic acid VPA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor HDACI, can improve animal survival after hemorrhagic shock, and protect neurons from hypoxia-induced apoptosis. This study investigated whether VPA treatment works through the c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK/Caspase-3 survival pathways.   METHODS Wistar-Kyoto rats underwent hemorrhagic shock 60 blood loss over 60 min followed by post-shock treatment with VPA 300 mg/kg, without any additional resuscitation fluids. The experimental groups were 1 Sham no hemorrhage, no resuscitation, 2 no resuscitation hemorrhage, no resuscitation, and 3 VPA treatment. The animals were sacrificed at 1, 6, or 24h n=3/timepoint, and liver tissue was harvested. Cytosolic and nuclear proteins were isolated and analyzed for acetylated histone-H3 at lysine-9 Ac-H3K9, total and phosphorylated JNK, and activated caspase-3 by Western blot.   RESULTS Hemorrhaged animals were in severe shock, with mean arterial pressures of 25-30 mmHg and lactic acid 7-9 mg/dL. As expected, only the VPA treated animals survived to the 6- and 24-h timepoints none of the non-resuscitated animals survived to these time points. Treatment of hemorrhaged animals with VPA induced acetylation of histone H3K9, which peaked at 1h and returned back to normal by 24h. Hemorrhage induced phosphorylation of JNK active form and increased activated caspase-3 levels, representing a commitment to subsequent cell death. Treatment with VPA decreased the phospho-JNK P=0.06 expression at 24h, without changing the total levels of JNK P=0.89, and this correlated with attenuation of activated caspase-3 at 24h P=0.04, compared with the non-resuscitated animals.   CONCLUSION Treatment with HDACI, induces acetylation of histone H3K9, and reduces JNK phosphorylation and subsequent caspase-3 activation. This discovery establishes for the first time that HDACI may protect cells after severe hemorrhage through modulation of the JNK/caspase-3 apoptotic pathway."
Valproic acid,caspase-3 activation,"Growing evidence from in vitro studies supports that valproic acid VPA, an anti-convulsant and mood-stabilizing drug, has neuroprotective effects. The present study investigated whether VPA reduces brain damage and improves functional outcome in a transient focal cerebral ischemia model of rats. Subcutaneous injection of VPA 300 mg/kg immediately after ischemia followed by repeated injections every 12 h, was found to markedly decrease infarct size and reduce ischemia-induced neurological deficit scores measured at 24 and 48 h after ischemic onset. VPA treatment also suppressed ischemia-induced neuronal caspase-3 activation in the cerebral cortex. VPA treatments resulted in a time-dependent increase in acetylated histone H3 levels in the cortex and striatum of both ipsilateral and contralateral brain hemispheres of middle cerebral artery occlusion MCAO rats, as well as in these brain areas of normal, non-surgical rats, supporting the in vitro finding that VPA is a histone deacetylase HDAC inhibitor. Similarly, heat shock protein 70 HSP70 levels were time-dependently up-regulated by VPA in the cortex and striatum of both ipsilateral and contralateral sides of MCAO rats and in these brain areas of normal rats. Altogether, our results demonstrate that VPA is neuroprotective in the cerebral ischemia model and suggest that the protection mechanisms may involve HDAC inhibition and HSP induction."
Valproic acid,caspase-3 activation,"Two primary drugs used to treat bipolar mood disorder are lithium and valproate. Emerging evidence supports the notion that both mood stabilizers have neuroprotective effects. In primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule cells and cortical neurons, lithium and valproate robustly and potently protect against glutamate-induced, N-methyl-D-aspartate NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. The neuroprotective mechanisms involve inactivation of NMDA receptors through inhibition of NR2B tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of cell survival factors such as the PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway, and induction of neurotrophic/neuroprotective proteins, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor, heat-shock protein HSP, and Bcl-2. Both drugs are also effective against other forms of insults such as ER stress in neurally related cell types. The molecular targets likely involve glycogen synthase kinase-3 GSK-3 and histone deacetylase HDAC for lithium and valproate, respectively. In a rat cerebral artery occlusion model of stroke, postinsult treatment with lithium or valproate reduces ischemia-induced brain infarction, caspase-3 activation, and neurological deficits, and these neuroprotective effects are associated with HSP70 upregulation and, in the case of valproate, HDAC inhibition. In a rat excitotoxic model of Huntingtons disease in which an excitotoxin is infused into the striatum to activate NMDA receptors, short-term lithium pretreatment is sufficient to protect against DNA damage, caspase activation, and apoptosis of striatal neurons, and this neuroprotection is concurrent with Bcl-2 induction. Moreover, lithium treatment increases cell proliferation near the site of striatal injury, and some newborn cells have phenotypes of neurons and astroglia. Thus, lithium and valproate are potential drugs for treating some forms of neurodegenerative diseases."
Valproic acid,caspase-3 activation,"Therapy resistance represents a major problem for disease management in oncology. Histone deacetylase inhibitors HDACi have been shown to modulate the cell cycle, to induce apoptosis and to sensitize cancer cells for other chemotherapeutics. Our study shows that the HDACi valproic acid VPA and the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea HU potentiate the pro-apoptotic effects of each other towards several cancer cell lines. This correlates with the HU-induced degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors CDKI p21 and p27, mediated by the proteasome or caspase-3. Moreover, we found that caspase-3 activation is required for VPA-induced apoptosis. Remarkably, p21 and p27 can confer resistance against VPA and HU. Both CDKI interact with caspase-3 and compete with other caspase-3 substrates. Hence, p21 and p27 may contribute to chemotherapy resistance as apoptosis inhibitors. Since the biological effects of VPA and HU could be achieved at concentrations used in current treatment protocols, the combined application of these compounds might be considered as a potential strategy for cancer treatment."
Valproic acid,caspase-3 activation,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the protective effects of valproic acid VPA on myocardium in rats following lethal burn injury and its mechanism.   METHODS Seventy-eight Sprague-Dawley SD rats were randomly assigned to four groups sham-scald group n=10, sham-scald  VPA group n=10, scald group n=29, and scald  VPA group n=29. Rats in the latter two groups were subjected to 55 total body surface area TBSA third-degree burns by immersing the back of the trunk for 15 seconds, both lower extremities for 15 seconds, and the abdomen for 8 seconds in 80 centigrade water. Sham-scald rats were immersed in 37 centigrade water instead. Rats were then subcutaneously injected with VPA 300 mg/kg or normal saline as control. Blood of 5 rats in each group was with drawn from the abdominal aorta at 6 hours after injury for measurement of plasma creatine kinase-MB CK-MB activities then the rats were sacrificed and heart tissues were harvested for the measurement of acetylated histone H3 and activated caspase-3 by Western Blot. The remaining rats were used for 12-hour survival analysis.   RESULTS Compared with sham-scald group, there was a significant increase in plasma CK-MB activities 5 438.0  413.6 U/L vs. 2 881.0  324.8 U/L, Plt0.05 and activated caspase-3 protein levels in heart tissue gray value 1.75  0.25 vs. 1.00  0.18, Plt0.05 and an significant decline in the acetylation levels of histone H3 gray value 0.55  0.18 vs. 1.00  0.20, Plt0.05 after major burn injury. VPA treatment significantly reduced the plasma CK-MB activities 4 018.0  388.3 U/L, activated caspase-3 protein levels in heart tissue gray value 1.33  0.20, and raised the acetylation levels of histone H3 gray value 2.20  0.23, all Plt0.05. Survival analysis by Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the survival was improved after VPA treatment, and the survival rate was increased from 0 to 50 at 12 hours Plt0.05.   CONCLUSIONS VPA can attenuate cardiac injury and improve survival in a rodent model of lethal burn injury. These protective effects may be due to its inhibitory effects on histone deacetylase and caspase-3 activation."
Valproic acid,caspase-3 activation,"Autism spectrum disorder ASD is a neurodevelopmental condition that is characterized by difficulty in social behavior and restricted behaviors. Also, in ASD, several accompanying disorders such as anxiety are observed. Considering the important role of amygdala in the pathophysiology of ASD, the present study focused on the neuronal changes and it possible signaling pathway in amygdala. After prenatal exposure to valproate VPA 600 mg/kg, i.p, on embryonic day 12.5, amount of ROS, MMP, caspase-3 activity, AMPK, SIRT1 and PGC1 proteins, and parvalbumin interneurons in the amygdala were assessed following evaluation of ASD and anxiety-like behaviors. Amygdala analysis revealed ROS accumulation and decreased MMP in autistic rats. In addition, caspase-3 activation elevated and immunoreactivity for parvalbumin interneurons decreased. These were accompanied by anxiety and autistic-like behaviors in open field test, elevated zero maze and U-Shaped 2 Choice Field maze. Also, our data showed that in the valproate group, protein levels of AMPK, SIRT1 and PGC1 reduced. Collectively, our results indicate that prenatal exposure to valproate leads to anxiety and autistic-like behaviors, partly through its targeting amygdala parvalbumin interneurons dysfunction and this might be affected by disturbed AMPK/SIRT1/PGC1 signaling pathway."
Verapamil,caspase-3 activation,"Ferutinin, isolated from the root of Ferula hermonis and proposed to be used as an antiosteoporosis phytoestrogen, has death promoting activities in a number of cancer cells. However, the effect of ferutinin on the induction of apoptosis in human red blood cells RBCs, also known as eryptosis or erythroptosis, remains unclear. Given that ferutinin is a small molecule that can induce apoptosis in the cancer cells by opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pores, we therefore hypothesized that the effect of ferutinin to elicit apoptosis in human RBCs devoid of mitochondria would be minimal. This study tried to determine the in vitro effect of ferutinin on the induction of apoptosis in human RBCs. Eryptosis/erythroptosis after ferutinin treatment was examined for phosphatidylserine PS externalization, calcein leakage, and other apoptotic feature events by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Contrary to our prediction, ferutinin caused eryptosis/erythroptosis in human RBCs and simultaneously increased caspase-3 activity and the cytosolic free Ca2 ion level Ca2i. Yet, Ca2 seems not to be the sole mediator in ferutinin-mediated eryptosis/erythroptosis because depletion of the external Ca2 could not eliminate the apoptotic effect from ferutinin. Subsequent replenishment of the external Ca2 was able to promote PS externalization, caspase-3 activation, and rise of Ca2i. Also, ferutinin at high dose 40 M or above was able to permeabilize the membrane of RBC ghosts in a way similar to that of digitonin. At low dose, ferutinin activated the P- and L-type Ca2 channels as the ferutinin-mediated Ca2i rise was suppressed by the P-type -agatoxin IVA and L-type verapamil and diltiazem Ca2 channel blockers. Taken together, we report here for the first time that ferutinin induces in vitro apoptosis in human RBCs. Mechanistically, eryptosis/erythroptosis is mediated by membrane permeabilization and upregulation of Ca2i with the activation of caspase-3."
Verapamil,COX-2 inhibition,"OBJECTIVE The efficacy of vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF, COX-2, calcium and aromatase inhibitors in an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome OHSS rat model was tested.   METHODS One hundred and eight female Wistar rats were randomly divided in nine groups. The control group received saline, while the OHSS group received rec-FSH for 4 consecutive days. The other seven groups received rec-FSH 4d and Bevacizumab twice, Parecoxib daily, Verapamil daily, Parecoxib daily and Bevacizumab twice, Verapamil daily and Bevacizumab twice, Parecoxib and Verapamil daily, Letrozole and Meloxicam daily, respectively. All groups received also hCG at the 5th day.   RESULTS All intervention groups were characterized by reduced vascular permeability compared to the OHSS group, which in the groups of Verapamil Calcium inhibition and Parecoxib  Verapamil COX-2  Calcium inhibition presented significant statistical difference. The Verapamil group showed the lowest corpus luteum formation, while the Parecoxib COX-2 inhibition, the Parecoxib  Verapamil COX-2  Calcium inhibition, the Bevacizumab  Parecoxib VEGF  COX-2 inhibition and the Bevacizumab  Verapamil VEGF  Calcium inhibition groups were also characterized by lower corpus luteum numbers compared to the OHSS group. Furthermore, lower graafian follicle formation was observed in the above groups, while the ovarian weight and the hormonal profile were not significantly affected.   CONCLUSIONS Studying the different check points of the VEGF pathway, we conclude that targeting calcium pathways could be beneficial for the vascular permeability control in an OHSS animal model."
Verapamil,caspase-3 activation,"The abundance of dead macrophages in close proximity to HOCl-modified proteins in advanced atherosclerotic plaques implicates HOCl in the killing of macrophages and the formation of the necrotic core region. The mechanism of HOCl mediated death of macrophages was unknown, so using human monocyte derived macrophages HMDM we here have shown that HOCl causes a rapid necrotic cell death characterized by loss of MTT reduction, cellular ATP and cell lysis without caspase-3 activation in HMDM cells. The HOCl causes a rise in cytosolic calcium level via the plasma membrane L- and T-type calcium channels and endoplasmic reticulum RyR channel. Blocking of the calcium channels or the addition of calpain inhibitors prevents the HOCl mediated loss of mitochondrial potential, lysosome failure and HMDM cell death. Blocking MPT-pore formation with cyclosporin A also prevents the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosomal destabilization and HMDM cell death. Blocking the calcium mitochondrial uniporter with ruthenium red also blocks the loss of mitochondrial potential but only at high concentrations. HOCl appears to cause HMDM cell death through destabilization of cytosolic calcium control resulting in the failure of both the mitochondria and lysosomes."
Verapamil,caspase-3 activation,"Multidrug resistance MDR is a phenomenon in which cells become resistant to cytostatic drugs and other substances with diverse chemical structures and cytotoxicity mechanisms. The most often observed molecular mechanism for MDR includes high levels of P-glycoprotein P-gp--an ABCB1 member of the ABC drug transporter family. Overexpression of P-gp in neoplastic tissue is an obstacle to chemotherapeutic treatment. Herein, we were focused on differences in apoptosis induced by cisplatin no substrate for P-gp between P-gp-positive and P-gp-negative L1210 cells. P-gp-positive cells were obtained by either L1210 cell adaptation to vincristine R or L1210 cell transfection with the human gene for P-gp T and compared with parental L1210 cells S. R and T cells were more resistant to CisPt than S cells. R and T cell resistance to CisPt-induced apoptosis could not be reversed by verapamil a well-known P-gp inhibitor, which excludes P-gp transport activity as a cause of CisPt resistance. CisPt induced a more pronounced entry into apoptosis in S than R and T cells, which was measured using the annexin-V/propidium iodide apoptosis kit. CisPt induced more pronounced caspase-3 activation in S than R and T cells. CisPt did not induce changes in the P-gp protein level for R and T cells. While similar levels of Bax and Bcl-2 proteins were observed in P-gp-negative and P-gp-positive cells, CisPt induced a more significant decrease in Bcl-2 levels for S cells than P-gp-positive cells. Expression of p53 and its molecular chaperone Hsp90 were more pronounced in R and T than S cells. Moreover, CisPt enhanced the upregulation of p53 and Hsp90 in R and T cells to a higher degree than S cells. Apoptosis was shown to be the prevalent mode of cell death in S, R and T cells by the typical DNA fragmentation and cell ultrastructure changes. All of the above findings indicate that P-gp, independent of its drug efflux activity, induced changes in cell regulatory pathways that confer a partial loss of cisplatin sensitivity."
Verapamil,caspase-3 activation,"Primary Sjgrens syndrome pSS is an autoimmune disease that targets salivary and lachrymal glands, characterized by anti-cholinergic autoantibodies directed against the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor mAChR. The aim of this work was to evaluate if cholinergic autoantibodies contained in IgG purified from Sjgren sera could trigger apoptosis of A253 cell line. We also determined if caspase-3 and matrix metalloproteinase-3 MMP-3 are involved in the induction of A253 cell death. Our results demonstrated that anti-cholinergic autoantibodies stimulate apoptosis and inositol phosphate InsP accumulation accompanied by caspase-3 activation and MMP-3 production. All of these effects were blunted by atropine and J104794, indicating that M3 mAChRs are impacted by the anti-cholinergic autoantibodies. The intracellular pathway leading to autoantibody-induced biological effects involves phospholipase C PLC, calcium/calmodulin CaM and extracellular calcium as demonstrated by treatment with U-73122, W-7, verapamil, BAPTA and BAPTA-AM, all of which blocked the effects of the anti-cholinergic autoantibodies. In conclusion, anti-cholinergic autoantibodies in IgG purified from pSS patients sera mediates apoptosis of the A253 cell line in an InsP, caspase-3 and MMP-3 dependent manner."
Verapamil,L-type calcium channel blockade,"The need for novel antifibrillatory therapy is underscored by clinical trials indicating that the incidence of sudden cardiac death is increased by sodium or potassium channel blockade and is only partially reduced by beta-blockade. We examined the efficacy of nexopamil, which possesses the unique combination of calcium channel and 5-HT2 receptor blockade, in preventing ventricular tachycardia VT and fibrillation VF and reducing T-wave alternans magnitude during coronary artery occlusion and abrupt reperfusion in dogs. The results were compared with L-type calcium channel blockade alone with diltiazem. The effect of nexopamil was tested during a 10-min period of left anterior descending LAD coronary artery occlusion and release in chloralose-anesthetized dogs. T-wave alternans magnitude was assessed by complex demodulation. The drug reduced the incidence of VT during occlusion from 5 of 6 to 0 of 6, p lt 0.03 and VT/VF during abrupt reperfusion from 5 of 6 to 0 of 6, p lt 0.03 and suppressed the T-wave alternans magnitude increase induced by occlusion from 14.62 /- 3.96 to 1.39 /- 0.34 mV x ms, p lt 0.01 and reperfusion from 17.33 /- 4.67 to 2.34 /- 0.77 mV x ms, p lt 0.01. When 30-s left stellate ganglion stimulation 10 V, 5-ms pulses, 10 Hz was superimposed on occlusion, nexopamil reduced the VT/VF incidence from 8 of 11 to 4 of 11, p lt 0.05 and T-wave alternans magnitude from 24.80 /- 5.05 to 15.81 /- 5.09 mV x ms, p lt 0.05. Calcium channel blockade alone with diltiazem decreased the incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias from 5 of 10 to 1 of 10, p lt 0.05 and T-wave alternans magnitude from 16.75 /- 3.06 to 2.87 /- 1.23 mV x ms, p lt 0.05 during coronary artery occlusion. During reperfusion, diltiazems reduction in arrhythmia incidence from 5 of 8 to 2 of 8 was not statistically significant, although the decrease in T-wave alternans from 28.60 /- 3.43 to 8.27 /- 3.73 mV x ms, p lt 0.05 was significant. Therefore, nexopamil was superior to diltiazem in protecting against reperfusion-induced arrhythmias. Nexopamils significant antifibrillatory effect during both coronary artery occlusion and abrupt reperfusion is reliably tracked by T-wave alternans magnitude. Because the major component of the protection could be reproduced by blockade of the L-type calcium channel with diltiazem, nexopamils antiarrhythmic action appears to be due mainly to blockade of this channel. Nexopamils antiplatelet action through blockade of 5-HT2 receptors may confer additional protection against reperfusion arrhythmias."
Verapamil,caspase-3 activation,"The prefrontal cortex is the largest lobe of the brain and is consequently involved in stroke. There is no comprehensive practical pharmacological strategy for ameliorating prefrontal cortex injury induced by cerebral ischemia. Therefore, we studied the neuroprotective properties of verapamil Ver on mitochondrial dysfunction and morphological features of apoptosis in transient global ischemia/reperfusion I/R. Ninety-six Wistar rats were allocated into four groups control, I/R, I/RVer 10 mg/kg twice 1 hour prior to ischemia and 1 hour after reperfusion phase, and I/RNaCl vehicle. Animals were sacrificed, and mitochondrial dysfunction parameters i.e., mitochondrial swelling, mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP concentration, ROS production, and cytochrome c release, antioxidant defense i.e., superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and caspase-3 activation, and morphological features of apoptosis were determined. The results showed that mitochondrial damage, impairment of antioxidant defense system, and apoptosis were significantly more prevalent in the I/R group in comparison with the other groups. Ver decreased mitochondrial damage by reducing oxidative stress, augmented the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the brain, and decreased apoptosis in the I/R neurons. The current study confirmed the role of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in I/R progression and indicated the possible antioxidative mechanism of the neuroprotective activities of Ver."
Verapamil,L-type calcium channel blockade,"This study tested whether mibefradil exerts a stronger inhibitory effect than verapamil on sympathetic neurotransmitter release provoked by electrical field stimulation. Tail arteries diameter 620/-9 microm were obtained from male Wistar rats. Ring segments of 2 mm length were mounted in an isometric wire myograph. After an appropriate period of equilibration and a priming procedure the vessels were either subjected to electrical field stimulation EFS frequency 0.25-4 Hz for 30 s or a concentration-response curve was generated with either noradrenaline concentration range 0.03-3 microM or ATP concentration 0.3 mM which served as baseline parameters. EFS-induced contractions were stable and reproducible and were blocked by tetrodotoxin 1 microM, guanethidine 3 microM, and the combination of suramin 0.5 mM and prazosin 3 microM. EFS-induced contractions 1 Hz were almost completely inhibited by 10 microM mibefradil 97 but only partly by 10 microM verapamil 73. Log IC50 values were -5.6 for mibefradil and -6.6 for verapamil. Calcium antagonists were equipotent in inhibiting noradrenaline maximum inhibition by mibefradil and verapamil by 70 and 75, respectively log IC50 -6.5 and -6.7, respectively and ATP-mediated contractions maximum inhibition by mibefradil and verapamil by 92 and 97, respectively log IC50 -6.5 and -7.0, respectively. Consequently mibefradil displays an additional effect on contractions provoked by EFS-induced sympathetic noradrenaline release which cannot be explained by L-type calcium channel blockade. Probably this effect of mibefradil is mediated by the blockade of prejunctional N-type calcium channels, thereby inhibiting sympathetic noradrenaline release. Since activation of the sympathetic nervous system in hypertension is both common and undesirable, a calcium antagonist displaying both L- and N-type calcium channel blocking activities, would have major advantages over calcium antagonists lacking N-type calcium channel blocking activities."
Verapamil,caspase-3 activation,"Arsenic trioxide As2O3 achieved dramatic remissions in patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia. Clinical reports have shown that treatment was associated with cardiotoxicity. We investigated the toxic mechanisms of As2O3 in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Clinically relevant concentrations of As2O3 2-10 microM reduced the viability of H9c2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The decreased cell viability was because As2O3 induced cell apoptosis cell shrinkage, nuclear alterations and caspase-3 activation, or even necrosis at higher concentrations. Inhibition of caspase-3 with a specific inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO, suppressed apoptosis induced by As2O3. In addition, reactive oxygen species formation and cellular Ca2 overload were observed in H9c2 cells exposed to As2O3, which was partly inhibited by vitamin E and verapamil. These results suggest that As2O3-induced cardiotoxicity is mediated, at least in part, by activation of caspase-3 pathway, which may be triggered by reactive oxygen species formation and intracellular Ca2 overload."
Verapamil,L-type calcium channel blockade,"Intracellular calcium signaling plays an essential role in cardiac physiology and modulates cardiac gene expression. However, the role that intracellular calcium signaling plays during cardiac development is not known. To address this issue, we examined the effects of altered intracellular calcium levels on cardiac morphogenesis. In acutely cultured mouse embryos, L-type calcium channel blockade decreased resting intracellular calcium levels and inhibited calcium transients. Embryos cultured at embryonic day E 7.5-8.5 in the presence of the L-type calcium channel blockers nifedipine and verapamil developed hearts that had a large left ventricle, lacked a right ventricle and had a long, thin outflow tract. If embryos were cultured at E7.5, calcium channel blockade also induced an abnormal, anterior cardiac loop. These alterations in development were not due to altered cardiac function, as heart rates at the end of the culture period were not affected by calcium channel blockade and blood flow was observed. Treatment with nifedipine altered the mRNA expression of the transcription factor Gata4, which was absent in the developing ventricles, and the sarcomeric protein Mylpc myosin light chain 2V, which was decreased distal to the left ventricle and was absent at the site of the developing right ventricle. In contrast, the expression pattern of other cardiac transcription factor Hand1, Hand2, Mef2c, Nkx2-5 and cytoskeletal protein Myhca, Tagln mRNA did not change with calcium channel blockade. These data demonstrate that proper intracellular calcium signaling is essential for normal cardiac looping, gene expression, and organ development."
Verapamil,caspase-3 activation,"Several studies have shown that simvastatin induces apoptosis in a variety of cell lines including vascular smooth muscle cells VSMCs, but the exactly mechanisms involved in it is not very clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms and signal pathways involved in apoptosis induced by simvastatin. When exposed to 30 microM simvastatin, Ca2i in VSMCs increased with time and reached to 336 /- 52 nM at 6 h, more than four-fold of control Plt0.01, n=5. Verapamil 80 microM, a membrane voltage-dependent Ca2 channel blocker, attenuated simvastatin-induced augmentation of free calcium concentration from 336 /- 52 nM to 144 /- 34 nM Plt0.01. After being exposed to 30 microM simvastatin for 8 h, calpain activity markedly increased Plt0.05, n=4 and reached to more than three-fold of control at 12 h Plt0.01. Caspase-3 was also activated by simvastatin after 12 h. Verapamil and PD150606, a cell-permeable selective calpain inhibitor, significantly inhibited simvastatin-induced augmentation of calpain activity and blocked caspase-3 activation, respectively. Furthermore, 80 microM verapamil and 100 microM PD150606 decreased simvastatin-induced apoptosis rate from 24.2 /- 1.7 to 7.9 /- 0.6 Plt0.01, n=4 and 9.5 /- 1.9 Plt0.01, respectively and also prevented simvastatin-induced DNA laddering. In conclusion, we indicated that simvastatin increases cytosolic free calcium concentration mainly through calcium influx from extracellular solution and then induces apoptosis by activating caspase-3 via calcium-dependent protease calpain."
Verapamil,L-type calcium channel blockade,"OBJECTIVES We tested whether mibefradil, a selective T-type calcium channel blocking agent, could differentially inhibit experimental ventricular arrhythmogenesis more than contractility during acute regional ischemia and reperfusion compared with that during L-channel blockade by verapamil.   BACKGROUND T-type calcium channels are found in nodal and conduction tissue and in vascular smooth muscle, but in much lower density in contractile myocardium. The potential role of mibefradil in ventricular arrhythmogenesis remains unclear.   METHODS Mibefradil Ro 40-5967, 1 mg/kg body weight intravenously i.v. was given as a bolus 30 min before anterior descending coronary artery ligation, followed by 2 mg/kg per h i.v. during 20 min of ischemia and 25 min of reperfusion in open chest pigs. In a second group, mibefradil was given in a dose twice as high. A third group received verapamil 0.3 mg/kg i.v., followed by an infusion of 0.6 mg/kg per h.   RESULTS During the ischemic period, the low clinically relevant dose of mibefradil prevented the fall of the ventricular fibrillation threshold, without depressing the maximal rate of pressure development of the left ventricle LVmax dP/dt. This low dose increased left ventricular blood flow, whereas peripheral arterial pressure remained unchanged. The higher dose of both mibefradil and verapamil was antiarrhythmic during ischemia, at the cost of depressed contractile activity. During reperfusion, only the higher dose of mibefradil and verapamil was antiarrhythmic but both depressed contractile activity.   CONCLUSIONS Mibefradil is antiarrhythmic, without inotropic compromise. Speculatively, both T-type and L-type calcium channel blockade are involved in these effects."
Verapamil,L-type calcium channel blockade,"In this study, the role that active tension development plays in the formation and maintenance of cardiac myocyte myofibrillar structure and cellular shape was investigated. By use of the calcium channel blocker verapamil, spontaneous contractile activity of neonatal rat heart myocytes was inhibited for 24 to 96 hours. Confocal microscopy of rhodamine phalloidin-stained cells revealed that, within 24 hours of contractile arrest, actin filaments of myofibrils were no longer aligned with one another at their I bands and Z lines. Cellular shape was also affected, with the cells developing a less stellate appearance while remaining attached to the substrate as well as to one another. By 48 hours, actin fibrils were largely absent from these cells. The disappearance of actin was confirmed by measurements of actin synthesis and accumulation rates and by pulse-chase biosynthetic labeling experiments. It was revealed that, although actin synthesis was significantly reduced in arrested myocytes, the rapid disappearance of total cellular actin was largely due to increased rates of actin degradation. Contractile arrest produced by L-type calcium channel blockade with verapamil or other calcium channel blockers accelerated actin degradation to a greater extent than K depolarization. Chloroquine partially suppressed the accelerated rate of actin degradation, indicating that lysosomal proteolysis may be involved in actin degradative processing. Protein kinase C activation also partially inhibited the accelerated rate of actin degradation but did not restore actin filaments in arrested myocytes. The reformation of actin fibrils and their reassembly into striated myofibrils occurred when contractile activity was restored by removal of verapamil from the culture medium. The period of time required for myocytes to reassemble actin filaments and to regain their elongated morphology was proportional to the period of time that the cells were inhibited from contracting. Data are presented to indicate that active tension development by neonatal cardiac myocytes in culture is critical to the maintenance of filamentous actin structure via mechanisms involving actin assembly, disassembly, and degradation."
Verapamil,L-type calcium channel blockade,"We have used the model of L-2-chloropropionic acid L-CPA-induced selective cerebellar granule necrosis to study excitatory amino acid-induced necrotic cell death in vivo produced by the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate NMDA receptors. However, the mechanism for the NMDA receptor activation and the biochemical events which dictate the anatomical selectivity for the L-CPA-induced lesion are as yet unknown. We examined whether blockade of sodium and calcium channels may reduce the neurotoxicity through a reduction of glutamate release from granule cells. None of the sodium channel antagonists examined, i.e. phenytoin, lamotrigine or rilazole nor the mixed sodium/calcium channel blocker, lifarazine, altered the L-CPA neurotoxicity. However, L-type calcium channel blockers, verapamil and nifedipine enhanced the L-CPA-induced granule cell necrosis, assessed by measuring the degree of L-CPA-induced reductions in cerebellar aspartate concentration, increases in cerebellar glycine concentrations and the development of cerebellar oedema. In addition, the locomotor activity of rats receiving both L-CPA and either verapamil or nifedipine was significantly lower than when rats received L-CPA alone, suggesting an enhancement of the neurotoxicity of L-CPA by L-type calcium channel blockade. The data suggest that L-CPA may interfere with non-L-type calcium channels located on granule cell bodies and nerve terminals leading to reduction of the calcium entry into the cells. We suggest that a combination of L-type channel blockade and non-L-type channels which are sensitive to L-CPA produces reductions in intracellular calcium concentrations below that required for neuronal survival."
