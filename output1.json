Mitochondrial quality control takes a pivotal role in regulating oxidative stress and cell senescence. Genistein is a major isoflavone in soy products, which is best known for its ability to inhibit bone loss in both postmenopausal women and ovariectomized (OVX) rodents. Here we show that OVX-BMMSCs displayed premature senescence, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and mitochondria dysfunction, while genistein rescued these phenotypes. Using network pharmacology and molecular docking, we identified estrogen-related receptor \u03b1 (ERR\u03b1) as the potential target of genistein. Knockdown of ERR\u03b1 greatly abolished the anti-senescence effect of genistein on OVX-BMMSCs. Further, the mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy induced by genistein were inhibited by ERR\u03b1 knockdown in OVX-BMMSCs. In vivo, genistein inhibited trabecular bone loss and p16INK4a expression, upregulated sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator one alpha (PGC1\u03b1) expression in the trabecular bone area of proximal tibia in OVX rats.

Based on these findings, we investigated whether genistein could reduce HIF-1\u03b1 in BC cell lines. Furthermore, we performed molecular docking studies to characterize the sites of interaction between genistein and HIF-1\u03b1. In the present investigation, we prove, for the first time, that genistein downregulates HIF-1\u03b1 in BC cells.

Therefore, novel molecular targets and therapeutic strategies are needed to prolong patient survival. For this purpose, we investigated the effects of rottlerin and genistein separately and in combination on neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y, Kelly). First, the effects of rottlerin and genistein were investigated on cell proliferation. Different rottlerin (1-50 \u00b5M) and genistein (5-150 \u00b5M) doses were used as experimental groups compared to the control (DMSO\/vehicle). The IC50 dose was found to be 5 \u00b5M for rottlerin and 30 \u00b5M for genistein (P < 0.0001). Other analyses, such as colony formation assays, annexin V\/propidium iodide staining, matrigel invasion assays, and Western blot analysis, were performed with these doses and their combinations. To assess statistical significance, statistical analysis was conducted using the one-way ANOVA with the post hoc Tukey test. Our results showed that IC50 doses of rottlerin and genistein induced a significant reduction in cell proliferation, colony formation, and invasion in neuroblastoma cells (P < 0.0001). The combination of these doses increased the levels of inhibition of cell proliferation and invasion while decreasing the level of apoptosis (P 0.0001). Furthermore, these agents caused G1-cell cycle arrest in these cells. Our western blot data showed that rottlerin and genistein treatments markedly inhibit elongation factor 2 kinase (EF2K) and other pro-tumorigenic, metastatic proteins in neuroblastoma cells. These agents probably showed their anti-proliferative, anti-metastatic, and pro-apoptotic effects through EF2K downregulation. Our results suggested that rottlerin and genistein have inhibitory effects on cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and cell cycle and induce apoptosis in both cell lines.

Proliferation then declined, and a concentration higher than 20 \u00b5M\/L showed significant inhibition. In addition, genistein treatment promoted myoblast differentiation at a dose of 10 \u00b5M\/L. However, at treatment concentrations higher than 10 \u00b5M\/L, the effect on myoblast differentiation was rapidly inhibited as the concentration increased. Genistein treatment also down-regulated the expression of miR-222, resulting in increased expression of its target genes, MyoG, MyoD, and ER\u03b1 and thereby promoting myoblast differentiation.

A549 and H1299 cells were treated in the presence or absence of different concentrations (0, 60 or 120 \u00b5mol) of propofol for different durations (0, 24, 48 or 72 h), and proliferation was detected by MTT and colony formation assays; the protein levels of optineurin (OPTN) ubiquitination, HECT domain and ankyrin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (HACE1), methyl-CpG binding domain protein 3 (MBD3) and Microtubule-associated protein 1A\/1B-light chain 3 were detected by immunoblotting or quantitative (q)PCR; the methylation state of the HACE1 gene promoter was detected by bisulfite DNA sequencing; and binding of MBD3 on HACE1 gene promoter was detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR. Propofol inhibited proliferation of A549 and H1299 cells and promoted HACE1-OPTN axis-mediated selective autophagy activity by increasing the protein expression levels of HACE1 via demethylating its promoter region.

This study focuses on the role of propofol on the oxidative stress of hepatic cells and the involved lncRNA-TUG1\/Brahma-related gene 1 (Brg1) pathway in HIRI mice. The mouse HIRI model was established and was intraperitoneally injected with propofol postconditioning. Hepatic injury indexes were used to evaluate HIRI. The oxidative stress was indicated by increasing 8-isoprostane concentration. Mouse hepatic cell line AML12 was treated with hypoxia and subsequent reoxygenation (H\/R). The targeted regulation of lncRNA-TUG1 on Brg1 was proved by RNA pull-down, RIP (RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation) and the expression level of Brg1 responds to silencing or overexpression of lncRNA-TUG1. Propofol alleviates HIRI and induces the upregulation of lncRNA-TUG1 in the mouse HIRI model. Propofol increases cell viability and lncRNA-TUG1 expression level in H\/R-treated hepatic cells. In H\/R plus propofol-treated hepatic cells, lncRNA-TUG1 silencing reduces cell viability and increased oxidative stress. LncRNA-TUG1 interacts with Brg1 protein and keeps its level via inhibiting its degradation.

However, its toxicity is a matter of grave concern for public health. Even worse, ACR is frequently detected in numerous fried or baked carbohydrate-rich foods due to the Maillard browning reaction. Herein, this study intends to delineate the underlying molecular mechanisms of Fe ions released from iron-binding protein transferrin (TF) after acrylamide binding by combining multiple methods, including multiple complementary spectroscopic techniques (UV-Vis, fluorescence, and circular dichroism spectroscopy), isothermal titration calorimetry, ICP-MS measurements, and modeling simulations. Results indicated that free Fe was released from TF only under high-dose ACR exposure (>100 \u03bcM). Acrylamide binding induced the loosening and unfolding of the backbone and polypeptide chain and destroyed the secondary structure of TF, thereby leading to protein misfolding and denaturation of TF and forming a larger size of TF agglomerates. Of which, H-binding and van der Waals force are the primary driving force during the binding interaction between ACR and TF. Further modeling simulations illustrated that ACR prefers to bind to the hinge region connecting the C-lobe and N-lobe, after that it attaches to the Fe binding sites of this protein, which is the cause of free Fe release from TF. Moreover, ACR interacted with the critical fluorophore residues (Tyr, Trp, and Phe) in the binding pocket, which might explain such a phenomenon of fluorescence sensitization. The two binding sites (Site 2 and Site 3) located around the Fe (III) ions with low-energy conformations are more suitable for ACR binding. Collectively, our study demonstrated that the loss of iron in TF caused by acrylamide-induced structural and conformational changes of transferrin.","question":"Which target interaction with acrylamide","output":"Transferrin (TF) misfolding"},{"Context":"Obesity is a critical risk factor for various diseases including type II diabetes, cerebral infarction, cardiovascular diseases, and various cancers.

Caffeine is known as a mild stimulant of the central nervous system, which is also closely related to neurologic disease. However, it is unknown whether caffeine causes hearing loss, and there is great interest in determining the effect of caffeine in cochlear hair cells. First, we explored the difference in auditory brainstem response (ABR), organ of Corti, stria vascularis, and spiral ganglion neurons between the control and caffeine-treated groups of C57BL\/6 mice. RNA sequencing was conducted to profile mRNA expression differences in the cochlea of control and caffeine-treated mice. A CCK-8 assay was used to evaluate the approximate concentration of caffeine. Flow cytometry, TUNEL assay, immunocytochemistry, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting were performed to detect the effects of SGK1 in HEI-OC1 cells and basilar membranes. In vivo research showed that 120 mg\/ kg caffeine injection caused hearing loss by damaging the organ of Corti, stria vascularis, and spiral ganglion neurons. RNA-seq results suggested that SGK1 might play a vital role in ototoxicity. To confirm our observations in vitro, we used the HEI-OC1 cell line, a cochlear hair cell-like cell line, to investigate the role of caffeine in hearing loss. The results of flow cytometry, TUNEL assay, immunocytochemistry, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting showed that caffeine caused autophagy and apoptosis via SGK1 pathway.

Western blot analysis suggested that GSK650394 and CoCl2 relieved the caffeine-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Together, these results indicated that caffeine induces autophagy and apoptosis in auditory hair cells via the SGK1\/HIF-1\u03b1 pathway, suggesting that caffeine may cause hearing loss.

Furthermore, caffeine (50 \u03bcM) induced significant mitochondrial shortening through the increased phosphorylation of mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) in HUVECs, which increased its activity to regulate mitochondrial fission. Pharmacological blockade of Drp1 by Mdivi-1 (10 \u03bcM) or disturbance of mitochondrial fission by Drp1 silencing markedly suppressed caffeine-induced lamellipodia formation and endothelial cell migration. Moreover, we showed that caffeine-induced mitochondrial fission led to accumulation of more mitochondria in lamellipodia regions and augmentation of mitochondrial energetics, both of which were necessary for cell migration. In a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia, administration of caffeine (0.05% in 200 mL drinking water daily, for 14 days) significantly promoted angiogenesis and perfusion as well as activation of endothelial AMPK signaling in the ischemic hindlimb. Taken together, caffeine induces mitochondrial fission through cAMP\/PKA\/AMPK signaling pathway. Mitochondrial fission is an integral process in caffeine-induced endothelial cell migration by altering mitochondrial distribution and energetics.","question":"Which target interaction with caffeine","output":"Mitochondrial Fission Protein Dynamin-Related Protein 1 (Drp1) activation"},{"Context":"Skin cells are vulnerable to oxidative stress-induced senescence, which may lead to abnormal aging or aging-related disorders. Therefore, strategies that can ameliorate oxidative stress-induced senescence are expected to protect skin from damage, holding the promise of treating skin diseases in the clinic. This study aims to investigate whether caffeine, a well-known purine alkaloid, is able to prevent skin from oxidative stress-induced senescence, and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Methods: A free radical inducer 2,2'-Azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) was used to induce oxidative stress and cellular senescence in both transformed skin cells and in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs). Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation was established as the in vivo oxidative stress model in mouse skin tissues. Cellular senescence was determined by SA \u03b2-galactosidase staining, immunofluorescence and western blotting. Activation of autophagy was confirmed by western blotting, immunofluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection by commercial kits, gene knockdown by RNA interference (RNAi) and receptor activation\/inactivation by agonist\/antagonist treatment were applied in mechanistic experiments. Results: We report that AAPH induced senescence in both transformed skin cells and in NHEKs. Similarly, UV irradiation induced senescence in mouse skin tissues. Remarkably, low dose of caffeine (<10 \u03bcM) suppressed cellular senescence and skin damage induced by AAPH or UV. Mechanistically, caffeine facilitated the elimination of ROS by activating autophagy. Using a combination of RNAi and chemical treatment, we demonstrate that caffeine activates autophagy through a series of sequential events, starting from the inhibition of its primary cellular target adenosine A2a receptor (A2AR) to an increase in the protein level of Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) and to the activation of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Oral administration of caffeine increased the protein level of SIRT3, induced autophagy, and reduced senescence and tissue damage in UV-irradiated mouse skin. On the other hand, co-administration with autophagy inhibitors attenuated the protective effect of caffeine on UV-induced skin damage in mice. Conclusion: The results reveal that caffeine protects skin from oxidative stress-induced senescence through activating the A2AR\/SIRT3\/AMPK-mediated autophagy. Our study not only demonstrated the beneficial effect of caffeine using both in vitro and in vivo models, but also systematically investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms. These discoveries implicate the potential of caffeine in the protection of skin disease.","question":"Which target interaction with caffeine","output":"Adenosine A2a Receptor (A2AR) inhibitor"},{"Context":"Skin cells are vulnerable to oxidative stress-induced senescence, which may lead to abnormal aging or aging-related disorders.

A better understanding of how this metabolic reprogramming contributes to neuroblastoma development could help identify potential prevention and treatment strategies. Here, we report that both the cholesterol and nonsterol geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate branches of the mevalonate pathway are critical to sustain neuroblastoma cell growth. Blocking the mevalonate pathway by simvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug, impeded neuroblastoma growth in neuroblastoma cell line xenograft, patient-derived xenograft (PDX), and TH-MYCN transgenic mouse models. Transcriptional profiling revealed that the mevalonate pathway was required to maintain the FOXM1-mediated transcriptional program that drives mitosis. High FOXM1 expression contributed to statin resistance and led to a therapeutic vulnerability to the combination of simvastatin and FOXM1 inhibition. Furthermore, caffeine synergized with simvastatin to inhibit the growth of neuroblastoma cells and PDX tumors by blocking statin-induced feedback activation of the mevalonate pathway. This function of caffeine depended on its activity as an adenosine receptor antagonist, and the A2A adenosine receptor antagonist istradefylline, an add-on drug for Parkinson's disease, could recapitulate the synergistic effect of caffeine with simvastatin. This study reveals that the FOXM1-mediated mitotic program is a molecular statin target in cancer and identifies classes of agents for maximizing the therapeutic efficacy of statins, with implications for treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma.","question":"Which target interaction with caffeine","output":"A2A adenosine receptor inhibitor"},{"Context":"French consumers are exposed to mixtures of pesticide residues in part through food consumption. As a xenosensor, the pregnane X receptor (hPXR) is activated by numerous pesticides, the combined effect of which is currently unknown. We examined the activation of hPXR by seven pesticide mixtures most likely found in the French diet and their individual components. The mixture's effect was estimated using the concentration addition (CA) model. PXR transactivation was measured by monitoring luciferase activity in hPXR\/HepG2 cells and CYP3A4 expression in human hepatocytes. The three mixtures with the highest potency were evaluated using the CA model, at equimolar concentrations and at their relative proportion in the diet. The seven mixtures significantly activated hPXR and induced the expression of CYP3A4 in human hepatocytes. Of the 14 pesticides which constitute the three most active mixtures, four were found to be strong hPXR agonists, four medium, and six weak. Depending on the mixture and pesticide proportions, additive, greater than additive or less than additive effects between compounds were demonstrated. Predictions of the combined effects were obtained with both real-life and equimolar proportions at low concentrations. Pesticides act mostly additively to activate hPXR, when present in a mixture. Modulation of hPXR activation and its target genes induction may represent a risk factor contributing to exacerbate the physiological response of the hPXR signaling pathways and to explain some adverse effects in humans.","question":"which target interaction with diphenylamine","output":"\tCYP3A4 promotor"},{"Context":"French consumers are exposed to mixtures of pesticide residues in part through food consumption.

The homogenous HDAC has been associated with all major human parasitic pathogens and hence, it has been considered an attractive drug target for anti-leishmanial therapy. To assist in drug design endeavors for HDACs, an in-vitro study has been presented to investigate the VA inhibition on Leishmania donovani HDAC (LdHDAC). The regression analysis of VA by 24 hrs viability assay confirmed its activity against LdHDAC. Moreover, the toxicity of VA is also well documented. Thus, the in-silico experiments were also conducted to screen the non-toxic VA derivatives as anti-leishmanial drug candidates having potential as inhibitors of LdHDAC. For in-silico study, the 3D structure of target LdHDAC was developed by homology modeling. Based on their in-silico activity, we shortlisted 13 VA derivatives having maximum affinity for LdHDAC and identified four potential derivatives that can specifically bind to this protein. After that, these ligands were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation. These derivatives may be effective against L. donovani promastigotes since they followed Lipinski's RO5 and were non-toxic. Thus, screened derivatives can be considered as lead ligands for targeting LdHDAC and may be used as possible drug candidates to treat leishmaniasis and overcome the limitation of anti-leishmanial drugs. This is the first report of antileishmanial potential of VA and its derivatives targeting LdHDAC. Hence, the current investigation presents a search for novel target specific drugs to aid the anti-leishmanial drug development.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The potential of this therapy is still limited by several challenges, including the reduced expression of the dystrophin transcript and the strong 5'-3' imbalance in mutated transcripts. We therefore hypothesize that increasing histone acetylation using histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) could correct the transcript imbalance, offering more available pre-mRNA target and ultimately increasing dystrophin rescue. Here, we evaluated the impact of such a combined therapy on the Dmd transcript imbalance phenomenon and on dystrophin restoration levels in mdx mice. Analysis of the Dmd transcript levels at different exon-exon junctions revealed a tendency to correct the 5'-3' imbalance phenomenon following treatment with HDACi. Significantly higher levels of dystrophin restoration (up to 74% increase) were obtained with givinostat and valproic acid compared with mice treated with ASO alone. Additionally, we demonstrate an increase in H3K9 acetylation in human myocytes after treatment with valproic acid. These findings indicate that HDACi can improve the therapeutic potential of exon-skipping approaches, offering promising perspectives for the treatment of DMD.","question":"which target valproic acid interact with","output":"histone deacetylases  inhibitor"}]
