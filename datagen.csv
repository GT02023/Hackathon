"The expression of MMP-2, MEK4 and BASP1 was then measured in formalin fixed prostate tissue from N = 38 Chinese men living in China and N = 41 US men living in the US, both cohorts with localized PCa. MMP-2 was 52% higher in Chinese compared to US tissue (P < 0.0001), MEK4 was 48% lower (P < 0.0001), and BASP1 was unaltered. ",Which target interaction with genistein,BASP1 promotor

"Western blot verification indicated that heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1, HO-1) could be the core target.",Which target interaction with genistein,HMOX1 inconclusive
" genistein inhibited trabecular bone loss and p16INK4a expression, upregulated sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator one alpha",Which target interaction with genistein,Estrogen-related receptor alpha promotor
the expression level of FOXO3a and PUMA in NSCLC was significantly increased by genistein.,Which target interaction with genistein,FOXO3a  promotor
the expression level of FOXO3a and PUMA in NSCLC was significantly increased by genistein.,Which target interaction with genistein, PUMA promotor
that genistein downregulates HIF-1 aplha in BC cells. C.,Which target interaction with genistein,hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha inhibitor
"Our western blot data showed that rottlerin and genistein treatments markedly inhibit elongation factor 2 kinase (EF2K) and other pro-tumorigenic, metastatic proteins in neuroblastoma cells.",Which target interaction with genistein,elongation factor 2 kinase inhibitor
"Genistein effectively reduced CIP2A expression, and restored PP2A activities both in CIP2A/APP, CIP2A/tau co-expressed cells. Genistein reduced APP phosphorylation at T668 site. Meantime, Genistein ameliorated tau hyperphosphorylation through repressing the inhibitory effect of CIP2A on PP2A.",Which target interaction with genistein,CIP2A inhibitor
